This was a good habit that could help thieves to move even more furtively during [Stealth].</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, not only was Marvin currently in poor health, he also didn’t even have a class, so obviously he couldn’t even use [Stealth].</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After turning a corner, two youths could be seen paying their daily earnings to a robust man. Marvin recognized one of them, a level 2 Thief. These young thieves were stealing in the city, but all their loot had to be given to the gang managing them.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The sturdy man spotted Marvin and gave him a quick look, apparently noticing Marvin’s Nobility Emblem on his sleeve, and swore under his breath.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin lowered his head and quickly departed. The current him wasn’t qualified to stir up trouble.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">...</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Churches of various gods were currently having trouble developing in River Shore City, as it was a city under the rule of the South Wizards Alliance. It wasn’t limited to River Shore City either, as other cities were also facing this issue. However, over the past few years the Silver Church was the odd one out. They not only had a firm foundation in River Shore City, but they also became River Shore City’s third major power. This had something to do with the Silver God’s divinity. Although the arrogant wizards only ever believed in the greatest Wizard God Lance and never cared about the other gods, they still needed money.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In the aftermath of the fall of the God of Wealth, the Silver God, at the time still a weak divinity, was still worshipped by the businessmen. And the wizards who have been ruling Feinan for an era just followed suit.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin knew the character of the Silver Church’s Priests. These guys only thought of personal gains. As long as the payment was sufficiently generous, they were even willing to cast Divine spells with on you.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The Priests of the Silver Church also were the only ones from whom you could buy a healing spell with silvers.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The original young owner wasn’t unaware of this way of doing things. He merely thought he could save some money, but died as a result. Marvin didn’t want to repeat his mistakes.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The pawnshop was in a very remote place, the depths of an alley. However, based on Marvin’s memories, its reputation was pretty good. The owner was an old goblin wearing a pair of pince-nez. He looked cunning and deceitful. Seeing Marvin, he grinned. Obviously, Marvin was a regular customer.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">(T/N: pince-nez are those old glasses without the temples(ears support))</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After great effort, Marvin exchanged the exquisite pearl necklace for 150 silvers. In fact, according to his [Accounting], this necklace was worth at least 300 silvers on the market. If Marvin wanted to reclaim this necklace, he would need at least 330 silvers.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Pawnshops are profiteering businesses, but Marvin didn’t object at all, as his current strength wasn’t good enough to. His [Diplomacy] was at a pitiful 19 points and wasn’t able to influence the old goblin to yield any extra silvers.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He hid the pouch well. This world’s silvers were in fact the size of a pinkie fingernail. Even though 150 sounded like a lot, it could fit in a small pouch.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin left the pawn shop, taking advantage of the fact that the fever hadn’t worsened to find the Silver Church’s Priest on duty.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After paying 80 silvers, this seemingly simple and honest middle-aged Priest was finally willing to display the "Silver Church’s Radiance" to Marvin.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A simple [Remove Disease] and [Cure Light Wounds] removed Marvin’s fever status as well as getting him back to full HP.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"Under the effect of the spell [Remove Disease], your status has recovered to Healthy!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"[Weakness Penalty: Attribute Reduction - 70%] Removed."</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"HP recovered: 26/26"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">With the warm flow from the spell and the information popping before his eyes, Marvin couldn’t help being somewhat excited.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">‘That damned weakness penalty finally disappeared!’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">With his HP back to a full 26, he felt a lot stronger.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"You look quite healthy now, young man." The Priest of the Silver Church showed a trace of fatigue and hinted that it was time for Marvin to leave.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was merely a Priest at the lowest level that could only use three spells per day, and each use would use up a lot of his mental strength and spirit.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin quickly left, but he didn’t go back to the Fierce Horse Inn yet. Rather, he started his own plan.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">To survive in this world!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He needed his own strength. The invasions of the Gods and the Abyss were closing in. But the most pressing matter was that of his territory.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There were hundreds of gnolls, and if the River Shore City Lord didn’t dispatch his guards, then he couldn’t do anything about the gnoll elimination. And behind this inexplicable gnoll attack, Marvin smelled a hint of a conspiracy.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Especially since his task panel shockingly had the following soulbound quest:</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Reclaim your territory – Gnoll Invasion]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Quest Description: In the Summer of the year 297 of Fourth Wizard Era your territory met with a gnoll invasion. You narrowly escaped with your life and want the River Shore City Lord’s help. However, the city hall’s officials keep delaying the matter and this makes you feel suspicious. Perhaps your experiences in the city should keep you more vigilant. You cannot count on others; you can only rely on yourself.]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Quest Reward: 1000 general experience points (Exp).]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Mission Deadline: 29 days left]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">...</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Soulbound meant that the quest couldn’t be removed unless you deleted your account and started over. And the current Marvin obviously couldn’t delete his account by killing himself.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He had to admit that the quest reward was generous, as surprisingly the reward was 1000 general exp. General exp is of the highest grade of experience like battle exp and can be distributed to any class. 1000 general exp could make a level 1 adventurer class reach level 3 and still have some exp left over. It was fairly difficult to gain this much experience in this world. This could be considered an extraordinary leveling speed.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">‘The quest description explained things very clearly. I’m afraid that I can only complete it with my own power.’ If Marvin was still the original weak and incompetent noble, he could only welcome failure. Just as he said to Anna, he needed to change.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">First of all, he couldn’t rely on his general class, [Noble]. He needed a combat class.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">And as a god level player, Marvin already had an idea before stepping out of Fierce Horse Inn.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">...</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">River Shore City, Business District, Succubus Tavern’s backdoor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A beggar miserably cowering under a sleeping bag was pleading to the passersby, "Please give me some wine, even diluted with water..."</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He struggled to look up, and sniffed madly, apparently content just to detect the smell of alcohol on the passersby.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"Fuck off, old drunk!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A grumpy thug kicked the beggar and the pitiful man rolled a few times, still clutching his sleeping bag.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The group of people walking through the back door burst into laughter.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">They lacked sympathy toward these sorts. This was the grey area of the business district, and the slums were just two streets away. All sorts of gangs were endlessly fighting, and the most lucrative underground businesses were developing around here: organ markets, slave markets, military weapon markets, etc. Those gathering here were rarely good people.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beggar clutched his stomach and dispiritedly withdrew to his sleeping bag while holding his head.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After the group passed by, the alley became a little deserted.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However when the scent of pure rum suddenly flew in, he still couldn’t help but come out of his sleeping bag, holding his head. Apparently, he wouldn’t even mind taking another kick.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">His eyes were locked onto the bottle of rum that had just been opened.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"10 silvers for a bottle of golden rum," a young voice said.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beggar couldn’t stop looking at that bottle of golden rum and could only guess from the voice that it was a very young man.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"Sir, please have mercy, allow me to have some…" The beggar suddenly lunged toward the bottle, trying to grab it.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin, already expecting his reaction, took a step to avoid it. Looking at the beggar whose eyes reddened, he said, "To get something, you must first pay the price."</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beggar crawled out of the sleeping bag, and a stench filled the air. He kept swallowing and with a trembling voice he asked, "What do you want?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin smiled and passed him a handwritten letter, along with a red ink paste usually used for seals. He had prepared those beforehand.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Honestly, he couldn’t be sure whether this would work, but this was the fastest way to get a class. He had learned of this shortcut from his close friend in the game.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In "Feinan Continent", it wasn’t easy to get a class. First of all, you had to be well-trained (which meant to be at least level 5 in the basic [Commoner] class.) Then you had to complete a class quest to get the corresponding class.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">With Marvin’s current situation, if he tried to get the class the same way ordinary people did, it would take too long. He had to try to take a shortcut.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In order to take this shortcut, he even had to give up on his favorite and most familiar class, [Thief], and pick another similar class. Fortunately, the final advancement of this class was also [Ruler of the Night]. Otherwise, Marvin would definitely not give up the class he was the best at.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beggar took the letter and read it for a long time, shivering. Then he took out a pitch-black object.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">‘The bet paid off! This guy really was a high-level adventurer, at least of the second rank!’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin saw the class badge and knew that his guess wasn’t wrong. Although the beggar seemed weird, his ingrained movements exposed his former class.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">For example, that technical move when he curled up inside his sleeping bag was a very useful class skill – [Hide].</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">"I can’t do that, my conscience won’t allow it!" The beggar struggled.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin smiled encouragingly. "Of course you can." He gave the bottle of rum to the beggar.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beggar’s breathing suddenly became coarse. He took the pitch-black badge and pressed it on the ink paste, leaving a seal on the letter. It was a circle of holly leaves with the name Mark Chene in the middle.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Marvin was ecstatic when he received the letter. The beggar was eagerly drinking his golden rum, and before he had finished, Marvin had left the alley.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Recommendation letter received.]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Class Acquired.]</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Half an hour later when Marvin came out of the Ranger Guild, there was a sika deer badge on his chest.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This marked his success in getting a Rank 1 [Ranger] Class.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At the same time he also received a title with bonuses.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">[Newborn Ranger]</p>
