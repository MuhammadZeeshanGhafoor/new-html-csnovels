             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, why are you pretending to be rich?” Xavia asked contemptuously.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Rachel was startled after Gerald placed the black gold card on the counter.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This Universal Global Supreme Shopper’s Card for luxury stores was only available to the most wealthy and powerful families in the world.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There was no doubt that the owner of the black gold card was indeed very wealthy and powerful.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">On the other side, Wendy quickly brought the card reader over to the counter.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Gerald entered his birthday into the card reader as the passcode and the transaction was successful.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The transaction was successfully completed!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Oh my god!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone in the crowd was shocked.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Oh my. Did this young boy just buy the Hermes collector’s edition bag worth fifty five thousand dollars? He is really very rich!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Is this a boy really a very humble second-generation rich kid?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone was staring at Gerald with fiery eyes.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, even Yuri was staring at Gerald in disbelief.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">How could this pauper possibly be so rich? He felt a sharp pain in his heart.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Moreover, he was still showing off his knowledge on all of the luxury goods before this.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Now, he looked nothing more than a clown!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia had a look of disbelief on her face at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“You…you…Gerald, where did you get this card?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">How could he possibly buy the bag that was worth fifty-five thousand dollars whenever he wanted to? Xavia could not believe that Gerald also owned a Universal Global Supreme Shopper’s Card. Even that luxury shopper’s card was very valuable on its own!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Did he just buy the bag on his own?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Was it for real?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald glanced at Xavia but he did not say anything at all.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He could still feel a sharp pain in his heart but he was still very cold towards Xavia. At this time, Gerald thought in his heart, ‘My sister was the one who gave me this card and I can actually purchase something costing up to three hundred thousand dollars!’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, I will wrap this item up for you immediately! Please wait for half an hour.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“This is a very luxurious product so we must ensure that the packaging for the bag is perfect.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald felt very embarrassed with the crowd of people staring at him so intently.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After he rejected the wrapping service, Gerald took the bag in his hand as he prepared to leave immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Wait a minute! Stop right there!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri had an ugly expression on his face as he walked in front of Gerald to stop him from leaving.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“What do you want?” Gerald asked in a cold manner.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri snorted before he pointed at the black gold card in Gerald’s hand. “I suspect that you’ve stolen this black gold card from its original owner. After all, it isn’t that difficult to steal someone’s password or passcode nowadays!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Yuri looked at Rachel before he said, “Rachel, I’d advise you to call your manager to look into this matter immediately. If this black gold card was really stolen, it’ll leave a very bad reputation for your boutique store when this matter is exposed!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia came back to her senses at this time and she quickly chimed in, “Yes, Rachel. How can a pauper like Gerald possibly own such a supreme card and be able to purchase such an expensive bag?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia was still in disbelief.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Rachel felt that what they were saying made complete sense.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Therefore, she looked at Gerald before she said, “Sir, please wait here for a moment. Our manager will come over here right away.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, everyone blocked Gerald’s way as if they were trying to stop a fraudster from escaping!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald really did not expect to cause so much trouble just because he wanted to buy a bag.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, he knew that he would not be able to leave now even if he wanted to.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He could only stand here and wait patiently for the store manager.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Very soon, a woman in her early thirties who was dressed very elegantly appeared in front of the crowd of people.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Rachel immediately told the manager that she suspected Gerald to be a fraudster who had stolen someone else’s black gold card. </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The manager looked at Gerald before she smiled and said, “I am sorry, sir but if you do not mind, would you please allow me to check out your black gold card?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She was very polite and respectful because she was the manager of the store and she did not judge their customers simply by their appearances.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald felt very helpless at this time and he could only hand his black gold card over to the manager without saying anything.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The manager brought out a special card reader.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, she skillfully placed the card inside.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, could you please give me your last name? I would also like to know your identification number,” the female manager requested respectfully.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“My name is Gerald Crawford and my sister’s name is Jessica Crawford!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Even though his sister had put in his birth date as the passcode for his cards, Gerald was not sure if the card was under his name or his sister’s. Gerald also handed his identification card over to the manager without any hesitation.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Hm, let’s see how he’ll explain himself now!” Yuri said as he sneered. After that, he took out his cell phone so he could file a police report as soon as they found out the truth about Gerald!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The female manager proceeded with her inspection.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A short while later, a look of horror flashed through her eyes when she saw that Gerald was indeed the rightful owner of the black gold card.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was indeed a supreme member and this meant that he was a member of a very wealthy and powerful family in the world.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The manager broke out in cold sweat immediately. Damn it! Rachel had actually made her offend such an important and powerful customer!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The female manager took the card in her hand before she walked over to Gerald and bowed before him in a respectful manner.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Dear Mr. Crawford, I am so sorry if I have offended you. Please let me return your black gold card to you.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“What?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone was stunned.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Rachel was standing in Gerald’s way because she was trying to prevent him from leaving and she felt extremely embarrassed at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Manager…are…are you sure you did not make a mistake? Is this person really the owner of this black gold card?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The female manager raised her hand and slapped Rachel across her face. “Move aside now!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Rachel covered her face with her hand as she quickly stepped aside.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri and Xavia were in a daze.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The female manager knew that the two of them knew Gerald and they were the ones who were trying to ridicule and embarrass him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Therefore, she thought that it would be best if she could gain Gerald’s favor by chasing them both out of the Hermes store today!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The manager quickly walked up to Yuri and Xavia before she said, “Excuse me, what are both of you trying to prove? Why did you induce our salesgirl to offend our most valuable customer?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri stared at the manager before he said, “I was simply giving you a warning as a kind gesture!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“We appreciate your kindness but if you are not going to buy anything, we would truly appreciate it if you left our store immediately.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The female manager’s words were very sharp and cold.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She was chasing them out of the store!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia looked at Yuri, hoping that he would be able to get them out of this embarrassing situation.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Yuri was also sweating profusely at this time. Even if he forked out money to buy a bag worth ten thousand dollars, he would still be nothing compared to Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald was a supreme customer!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Let’s go!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri gritted his teeth in anger as he dragged Xavia out of the store.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Rachel was also bowing down in front of Gerald. “Sorry. I am so sorry, Mr. Crawford!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She regretted her actions and she really regretted judging her customers by their appearance.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald turned a blind eye to her and he simply smiled at Wendy before he said, “Thank you so much for all the trouble today. I don’t need you to wrap the bag up for me because I’m in a hurry. Goodbye!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Gerald took the bag in his hands before he left immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This was the first time that he had ever won in a battle with money.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In fact, he was not the kind of person who would spend so extravagantly.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Gerald was finally an ordinary person who could live his life without worrying about money!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After leaving the store, Gerald’s cell phone started ringing again. It was a phone call from Naomi.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald could hear Naomi’s anxious voice over the other end of the line as soon as he answered the call. “Gerald, I don’t care what other people think about you but you’re one of my closest friends! You have to come to my birthday party tonight. All of your dormitory mates are here already!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald smiled before he replied, “Alright, I’ll be right there!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“By the way, make sure that you look good today! I’d like to introduce someone to you!” Naomi said over the phone again.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald could only shake his head helplessly. Since he could not possibly give Naomi the bag without wrapping it up, Gerald walked to a nearby supermarket to buy a plastic bag for twenty cents. After that, he put the Hermes bag into the red plastic bag.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He then hailed a cab before he rushed to Jade Restaurant.        </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, at Jade Restaurant, Naomi hung up the phone before she smiled at the long-haired girl sitting next to her. The girl was absolutely beautiful and she looked like a goddess!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Alice, Gerald is a very close friend of mine. He’s a very good and studious person! I’d like to introduce you to him later.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice was wearing her earphones and she was shaking her legs as she listened to music.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She was really very pure and beautiful.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Okay!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice Bradford and Naomi were childhood friends who grew up together and they attended the same university even though they were majoring in different fields.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Since it was Naomi’s birthday today, she had invited Alice and some of her dormitory friends over to celebrate her birthday with her.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Naomi also knew that even though Alice was a goddess, she had been single since high school and she was currently looking for a boyfriend.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice opened a bottle of juice as she drank it in a graceful manner.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, the door opened…</p>
