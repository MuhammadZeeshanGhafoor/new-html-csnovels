             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald walked out of the room immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Naomi and the head of Gerald’s dormitory, Harper, chased after Gerald immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“What are you doing? I didn’t say that I don’t like your gift,” Naomi said anxiously.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Harper also spoke up at this time. “Gerald, don’t leave. Stay and have dinner before you go. If you leave now, we’ll be very bored here.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald smiled before he replied, “You guys can continue having fun here. There’s really something I have to do now but I hope you guys will believe I’m not the kind of person who would buy something fake!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald did not know if his friends would believe him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As he thought about it, Gerald could only blame his sister for giving him the card with a minimum spending amount of fifty thousand dollars.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Even though Harper and Naomi kept persuading Gerald, he still decided to leave in the end.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Did that pauper really leave?” Danny asked with a smile as soon as Naomi and Harper returned to the room.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Harper replied, “Danny, can’t you change the target of your bullying? Why are you always bullying Gerald? Isn’t he miserable enough?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Harper could not tolerate it anymore.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“He was the one who asked for it himself! Why did he buy an imitation Hermes bag to gift Naomi? Moreover, he even chose to give her a fake limited edition collector’s item. He’s really the worst!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice could only smile wryly as she shook her head.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald walked on the street without any emotions on his face after leaving the restaurant.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Gerald was really poor, all he wished for was to be rich. However, now that he was loaded with cash, he did not feel anything special at all.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Moreover, he bought his friend a bag that cost more than fifty five thousand dollars but he was still despised and ridiculed.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Just as Gerald was thinking of where he should head to, he suddenly received a phone call.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was a phone call from his sister, Jessica.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald immediately answered the call. “Sister!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald! What are you doing now?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I’m not busy at all…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“If you are free, could you do me a favor?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald was curious at this point.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Do you know Mayberry Commercial Street? I invested in that street and developed it when I returned to the country to see you four years ago. I need to sign a renewal contract with some of the investors but I can’t return to the country now.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Back then, I included your name in the development of the project. Therefore, Mayberry Commercial Street belongs to both of us. It’ll be the same even if you sign the contract! Go and renew the contract on my behalf.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Hello? Gerald, did you hear what I just said?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Of course, Gerald heard everything that she said.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, he was really confused at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Mayberry Commercial Street?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">That was one of the highlights of Mayberry City. </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There were many different shops and business establishments on the commercial street.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There was also a place called Wayfair Mountain Entertainment on top of the hill along the commercial street. This was a place that the wealthy and powerful people in Mayberry City would always visit.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">So, according to his sister, they owned the entire Mayberry Commercial Street?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sister, are you telling me the truth? We own the commercial street?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Damn it! I’ve been talking to you for such a long time already and you actually think I’m just kidding? Why would I joke about this? I couldn’t get involved in so many industries on my own, and that’s why I used your identity card. You own half of the commercial street now.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I’ve already spoken to Zack, the owner of Wayfair Mountain Entertainment. Once you arrive there later, just tell him your name and let him know you’re the second boss!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Okay, okay, that’s all. I’ve something else to attend to so I’ll hang up first!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Beep beep beep.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald held the phone in his hand and he was completely at a loss for words.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He had never been to Wayfair Mountain Entertainment before and he didn’t know what to expect at all.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald took a deep breath before he hailed a cab and headed straight to Wayfair Mountain Entertainment.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Wayfair Mountain Entertainment integrated dining, entertainment, and accommodation in one building.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was a huge manor located on the hillside on Mayberry Commercial Street. </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald raised his head before walking into the manor…</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, please wait!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald was unexpectedly stopped by a few beautiful ladies as soon as he entered the manor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, did you reserve a place here today?” one of the girls quickly asked as she looked at Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">These girls were responsible for all the reception work at the front hall and they were already used to receiving many VIP guests.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Gerald was dressed very casually compared to all the other wealthy and powerful people who usually visited.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Even though the beautiful girls had contempt in their eyes, they were still very polite towards Gerald. </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I didn’t reserve a seat but I’m here to look for someone,” Gerald replied as he smiled.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, he glanced at the beautiful girls in front of him and he finally understood why Wayfair Mountain Entertainment was considered a fairytale in Mayberry City.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">These five or six receptionists looked like students who had just graduated from college.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">They were all extremely beautiful and they had perfect figures like models.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“You’re here to look for someone? Who are you looking for?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The beautiful girls could not help but frowned when they heard Gerald’s words.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, there was a hint of coldness in their voices.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I’m here to look for Zack.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald knew that the girls were all looking down on him but he told them the truth anyway.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After hearing Gerald’s word, the few girls exchanged glances with one another.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Looking for Mr. Lyle?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Did this poor man know who Mr. Lyle was?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Was Mr. Lyle really someone that he could see whenever he wanted to?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, they finally concluded that Gerald was just a pauper who was here to experience what it felt like to be rich.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After all, Wayfair Mountain Entertainment was a famous place that many could never afford to enter.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There would also be others just like Gerald who would come by to say they were looking for someone just because they wanted to have a look around the manor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, they didn’t want to put him down.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">These beautiful girls were all college graduates. At this time, even though they despised Gerald for his actions, they tried to remain humble and polite.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, you’ll need to make an appointment in advance if you want to meet Mr. Lyle. Please leave if you have not made an appointment to meet him.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Gerald immediately knew that these girls were assuming he was there simply because he wanted to have a look around the manor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, he thought about calling Jessica so she could contact Zack on his behalf.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Miss Jane, what are you doing? I’ve just realized that just anyone can step into Wayfair Mountain Entertainment.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The person who just spoke was a young man with oiled hair and he was dressed very decently as he was accompanied by a glamorously dressed lady with heavy makeup.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The young man looked at Gerald with a contemptuous expression on his face as he smiled at the receptionist.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sebastian, didn’t you say that this is the most luxurious place in Mayberry City? Why is someone like him here?” the woman asked in a coquettish manner.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Some people are just born this way and they do not have the ability to express their feelings without any sarcasm.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The lead receptionist, Jane, quickly apologized to the young man and said, “Sorry, Mr. Lewis. We’ll deal with this as soon as possible.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Sebastian sneered before he said, “That’s good. I will be hosting a group of my friends from abroad here later and I think this manor is really the symbol of Mayberry City. Therefore, I hope you won’t degrade this place without reason. Miss Jane, I hope you understand that my father is very close to your boss, Mr. Lyle, and they often dine together.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Sebastian looked even more reputable as soon as he mentioned Mr. Lyle.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When the woman in his arms heard that Sebastian was acquainted with Zack, she smiled immediately because Mr. Lyle was a prominent figure in Mayberry City and she had no idea that Sebastian was so well-connected.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, all the beautiful girls at the reception counter were also staring at Sebastian because they were all hoping to attract his attention.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Jane nodded hurriedly before she replied, “Yes, I understand, Mr. Lewis.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Jane looked at Gerald with a stern expression on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sir, please leave immediately. Do not cause any trouble for our establishment. Otherwise, I’ll have no choice but to call for security!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Okay then. I’ll just step out and make a call first.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald took a deep breath before he walked out of the manor. He took his cell phone out of his pocket as he walked out of the manor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Damn! What a poser! He’s definitely a faker,” Sebastian said in a cold manner.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Please do not be offended, Mr. Lewis. This kind of situation occasionally occurs at Wayfair Mountain Entertainment.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Jane quickly appeased Sebastian with a smile on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Sebastian nodded before he said, “Oh look. My friends are here already. Why don’t you come and have a few drinks with us later?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I’ll definitely drop by if I have the time, Mr. Lewis,” Jane smiled reservedly.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Sebastian looked at Jane with a perverted expression on his face before he nodded. Then, he took his wallet out from his pocket before he walked towards the front desk to pay for his room.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, the group of beautiful girls looked at Jane with an envious expression on their face as they said, “Jane, do you know Mr. Lewis too?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Jane nodded arrogantly as she said, “Of course, we all started working here after graduating from college. What’s the point of working as a receptionist here if we don’t actually try to get to know more rich people like Mr. Lewis?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Did you see the coquettish woman in his arms just now? She is a second-rated actress…Mr. Lewis’ family is focused on the real estate business and their family has a net worth of more than two billion dollars!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Wow! It’s no wonder that his father is acquainted with our boss, Mr. Lyle.
