             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was nine o’clock at night at the male dormitory building in the university campus.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, please go down to dormitory 101 on the first floor and bring my laptop up for me!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A guy with blonde hair from the dormitory next door opened Gerald’s dormitory room door directly before he dropped one dollar on the floor, then turned around and walked away.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“By the way, please get me a bottle of mineral water from the supermarket downstairs too!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The blond-haired student turned around before he dropped another three dollars on the floor—two dollars for the bottled mineral water and another dollar for running the errand for him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Hey, Blondie! Why are the people in your dormitory always asking Gerald to run errands for you? Why are you guys being such bullies?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The people in Gerald’s dormitory asked in a cold manner because they could no longer stand it.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Hahaha! Gerald lives in your dormitory and you don’t understand him yet? If you give him a dollar, he’d even eat shit if you asked him to!” Blondie replied sarcastically. Then, he laughed before he left the dormitory.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald’s face flushed red with embarrassment as he turned a deaf ear to what the guy with blond hair said. After that, he bent down to pick up the few dollars on the ground before he thought to himself, ‘This way, I’ll make two dollars and that’s enough for me to buy three steamed buns and a bag of pickles! I won’t have to go hungry anymore.’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald...don’t go! If you don’t have enough money, we’ll lend you some and you won’t even need to pay us back!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The head of the dormitory could not stop himself from sympathizing with Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald shook his head before he smiled and said, “Thanks, but it’s okay…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After speaking, Gerald turned around to walk out of the dormitory. At this time, all the boys looked at Gerald’s back as they shook their heads in pity.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In fact, Gerald did not want to run errands for others and he wanted to enjoy his university life too.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It would be great if he could just continue studying in university without having to worry about anything.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, he was really very poor!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Although the other boys in his dormitory treated him very well, he did not want them to pity him. Otherwise, Gerald was afraid that they would eventually get sick of him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Apart from his dormitory roommates, Gerald had no other friends in university.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, I heard Blondie saying that you were heading downstairs, right?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, a very well-dressed boy exited from the dormitory next door.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">His name was Danny Xanders and he was the head of Blondie’s dormitory. He was every female students’ idol because he wasn’t only rich but he was also very handsome.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, he had always looked down on Gerald because he felt that Gerald was an embarrassment.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald could not understand why Danny would talk to him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald simply nodded and said, “Yes, I’m heading downstairs.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny smiled before he passed Gerald a box full of items.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“One of my friends will be waiting at the east grove today. Please pass him this box. Here’s ten dollars for you.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny was a playboy and everyone knew about how he’d often ask different girls to meet up with him at the grove.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny also had many friends who would do the same thing.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Gerald did not think too much about it as he was already used to running errands for others.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He simply took the box and the ten dollars before he walked downstairs. As soon as he turned around, he seemed to hear Danny’s faint laughter in the background…</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald went downstairs to pick up the laptop and buy the bottle of mineral water before he decided to drop the box of items off for Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The small grove outside the university was a very famous place for couples to have their secret rendezvous at night.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Gerald arrived at the place that Danny had mentioned to him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He could immediately see a man and a woman sitting in the woods, talking and laughing together.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Gerald was shocked when he saw the man and woman’s faces under the moonlight.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was stunned.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was Xavia!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald’s eyes reddened immediately and the items he was holding fell to the ground.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia was Gerald’s ex-girlfriend and it had only been three days since they had both broken up. Of course, it was Xavia who wanted to end the relationship.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When they were breaking up, Xavia had told him she wanted some time alone to herself. However, it had only been three days and she was already spending time with another man at the grove!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Both of them also noticed Gerald’s presence immediately and the expression on their faces changed abruptly.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald…why are you here? You, you…don’t get me wrong. I’m here with Yuri because…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia started to panic immediately, feeling very embarrassed at this time. She quickly lowered her head, not knowing how to face Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The boy named Yuri Lowell, who was a second-generation rich kid, glanced at the box of items that Gerald dropped to the ground before he laughed out loud.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Damn it! Danny really knows how to make a fool out of people. I asked him to send me this box of items and I really didn’t expect him to send you here to run his errands instead. This is exciting. This is really too exciting!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald knew that Yuri, who was a second-generation rich kid, was Danny’s close friend. His family owned several restaurants and he usually drove a BMW 3 series car to school.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald could only clench his fists tightly together after listening to Yuri’s words.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It turned out that Danny had intentionally done this.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Moreover, Gerald believed that Danny actually played a role in his break up with Xavia. Otherwise, why would Xavia be with Yuri just a few days after their break up?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Xavia, I know that you dislike me but you don’t have to get together with this kind of person after our break up. Do you know how many girlfriends he has changed before this?” Gerald yelled out loud.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He loved this girl very much. He really loved her.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia felt very anxious and annoyed when she heard Gerald’s words. “Gerald, who do you think you are? Who gave you the right to teach me how I should be acting and what I should be doing? I’ve already broken up with you and I can choose to be with whoever I want to be with!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Also…” Xavia was furious at this time. After that, she stared at Gerald before she said, “Did you come here to disgust me on purpose? Get lost!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Slap!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After she was done speaking, Xavia stepped forward and gave Gerald a tight slap across his face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yuri laughed even more heartily at this time. “Xavia, why are you chasing him away? You should just let him stay and watch us!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Xavia blushed immediately. “Yuri, I’ve already lost all interest after seeing this guy over here! Maybe next time…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, Xavia broke free from Yuri’s grasp.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald did not know how he walked away from the grove and his mind was completely blank at that moment.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everything came down to money. Gerald was in this state because he had no money!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Hahaha…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After returning to his dormitory, Gerald was greeted by the laughter of his classmates in the corridor.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny was holding his belly as he laughed out loud.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He had obviously told all of their classmates about this matter.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, what did you see when you were delivering the items earlier?” Blondie asked him with a smile on his face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Damn it! Xavia really has the most perfect figure,” Danny said as he grinned.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald clenched his fists tightly together and his eyes were flushed red at this time. He really wanted to kill Danny! He wanted to perish together with Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Why? Why are you doing this to me?” Gerald hissed angrily.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny laughed before he replied, “Hey, look here. I’m not scared of you at all.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Among all the poor people in our class, you’re the one I look down on the most! Xavia is such a beautiful woman and it’s such a waste for her to be in a relationship with someone like you! It’d be better for my brother to enjoy and play around with her for a few days at least…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“By the way, Gerald, did you know that Yuri managed to pick Xavia up after texting her for less than half an hour while you had to chase after her for more than a year before she finally agreed to be your girlfriend?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone was laughing at this time and no one cared about Gerald’s dignity at all.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I did it for you!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald rushed towards Danny immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As a result, he ended up getting beaten up by Danny’s buddies instead.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In the end, Gerald’s roommates came to his rescue and they brought him back to their own dormitory.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald covered his face with his quilt as he continued sobbing as he laid in bed.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">‘Why? Why must they bully me and trample on my dignity? Why?’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">‘Do I not have any feelings just because I’m poor? Am I not a person in their eyes?’</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald continued struggling internally and he could not stop the tears from flowing down his cheeks. He could not forget the scene that he had just witnessed tonight.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He did not know how long he huddled up under the covers, crying before he finally fell asleep.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Perhaps it was because it was such a dark and silent night, Gerald slept very peacefully that night.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When he woke up the next morning, there was no one in the dormitory. Gerald knew that the head of the dormitory must not have wanted to wake him up as he probably felt it would be better for Gerald to stay in the dormitory instead of going to the classroom after the previous night’s events!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Gerald picked up his cell phone, he discovered that he had received many text messages and missed calls.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">To Gerald’s surprise, they were all foreign numbers.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald also received a text message stating that someone had transferred money into his bank account!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“[Daxtonville Bank] Nineteen years. The balance of your account ending in 107 is USD 1,500,000.00.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald was stunned when he looked at the series of numbers.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">One million five hundred thousand dollars?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Who would transfer one and a half million dollars to him?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald hurriedly called the bank to confirm the transfer and he was even more confused after receiving confirmation from the bank.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, his cell phone started ringing again. It was another phone call from an international phone number and Gerald answered the call immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, have you received the money that I transferred to you? I’m your elder sister!” A familiar voice sounded over the other end of the line.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Sister! What the hell is going on? Aren’t you and our parents working hard to make money abroad? Where did you get so much money?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald was completely in shock.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Erm, our father was intending to hide the truth from you for another two years but I can’t bring myself to do so because I know you’re constantly getting bullied in school. Therefore, I planned to tell you the news in advance. Our family is actually really wealthy. The Crawford family has a huge business industry throughout the world. Do you know that eighty percent of the gold mines, minerals, and petroleum in Africa actually belongs to our family?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“This is not inclusive of all the other industries in Daxtonville and abroad.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">What!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald gulped immediately. If this one and a half million wasn’t already in his hands, he wouldn’t have believed this at all.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He really thought that his sister was merely making fun of him!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I know you find it really hard to believe me, Gerald, but you have to learn to accept the truth slowly. In the beginning, I was also raised in a poor environment but after some time, I’ve gradually gotten familiar with living the lifestyle of a wealthy person. By the way, I’ve sent something over to you by courier and it should arrive by this morning. You no longer have to worry about money in the future.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I don’t know how much anything costs in Daxtonville nowadays but you shouldn’t worry, just use the one and a half million dollars for the time being. I’ll call you again next month!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After hanging up the phone, Gerald was still in disbelief.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He had always lived as a poor person throughout his entire life.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">But…</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was actually a second-generation rich kid?</p>
