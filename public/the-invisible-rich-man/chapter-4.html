             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, the person who entered through the door wasn’t Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Danny! What are you doing here?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The expression on Naomi’s face changed as soon as she saw Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Both of them were classmates and Naomi was once close to them.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Naomi had found out that morning that Danny had played a trick on Gerald. Therefore, Naomi lost her temper at Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Unexpectedly, this guy was so thick-skinned and he actually came here even though she had just scolded him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Naomi, are you still angry? I was just joking around with Gerald last night. Who would’ve thought that he’d actually deliver the box to Yuri?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny replied as he smiled cheerfully.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Several of his roommates also came with him and they all brought gifts with them.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Speaking of it, Naomi’s family was also very wealthy and Naomi had already offered to help Gerald several times. However, Gerald had always rejected her goodwill.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny had known Naomi ever since they were in high school.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Naomi, is this the Gerald that you were going to introduce to me? What’s wrong?” Alice asked as she stared at Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As soon as Danny saw Alice, his eyes were shining brightly. In fact, he had already wanted to get acquainted with Alice ever since a long time ago. Alice was the most beautiful girl that he had ever seen in the Broadcasting and Media Department.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This time, the only reason why he gathered the courage to brazenly come and apologize to Naomi was because he knew that Alice would also be here.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As soon as Danny heard Alice’s words, he quickly said, “Hello, the beautiful Alice. Gerald is my classmate! He’s a pauper that I made fun of yesterday! Hahaha…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Danny recalled that Gerald had delivered some birth control supplies to his ex-girlfriend last night, Danny could not help but laugh out loud.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Shut up!” Naomi replied as she glared at Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Alice had a very strange expression on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Was there really such a huge distinction between the poor and rich students?</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald’s roommates also had a very ugly expression on their faces at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Okay, okay…I won’t say anything else.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny laughed before he said, “Naomi, why don’t you take a look at what I got for you…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, someone pushed the door open once again.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After opening the door, Gerald walked in with a red plastic bag in his hand.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, you’re finally here!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Naomi immediately jumped up with a smile on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald nodded in acknowledgment and he immediately noticed Danny, who was staring at him with a mocking expression on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In fact, Danny would have a humble expression on his face if it was any other second-generation rich kid. However…right now.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This was Gerald.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice also raised her head to look at Gerald at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In fact, Alice really wanted to look for a boyfriend but she could immediately tell that Gerald was probably not from a wealthy family. Alice did not mind if he was from an ordinary family as long as he was handsome and attractive.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, even though Gerald was handsome, Alice could tell that all the clothes that Gerald was wearing from head to toe were not worth more than fifty dollars.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was too ordinary!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Alice thought of what Danny had mentioned earlier, her impression of Gerald reached a new low point.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice’s face was filled with disappointment.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, this is Alice! Alice, this is my friend, Gerald.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Naomi introduced both of them with a smile on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald nodded before he replied, “Hello, my name is Gerald. Nice to meet you, Alice.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald extended his hand politely.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Alice did not even bother to look at Gerald. Instead, she simply turned around and continued sipping her juice.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald’s hand was hanging in the air and after a short while, he had to take his hand back in anguish.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Naomi knew that her best friend had always had such a personality. If she was interested in the guy, she would talk more. Otherwise, she would simply ignore him completely.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald did not say anything about it.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He simply walked over to sit down at the table.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this time, Danny saw the red plastic bag in Gerald’s hand.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny immediately said, “Well, Gerald, it is Naomi’s birthday today. So, what birthday gift did you get here? Why don’t you show it to us?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The head of Gerald’s dormitory could not stand it anymore and he quickly asked, “Danny, why are you always picking on Gerald?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny simply laughed because he really enjoyed ridiculing and making fun of others.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny glanced at Gerald with a cold expression on his face before he took out the gift that he bought for Naomi first.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It turned out that Danny also bought a black branded bag for her.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Naomi, I bought this for you. A Hermes bag.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As soon as Danny brought out the bag, Alice and all her beautiful roommates were immediately intrigued.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“A Hermes bag? The market price for one of these bags is at least eight thousand dollars, right?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">All of the beautiful girls immediately had a different impression of Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This person was really very generous.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice, the goddess who had always been very cold to everyone else, could not help but glance at Danny at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“It’s not that expensive. My dad knows the manager at Hermes very well, so I bought it for only seven thousand nine hundred dollars.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny smiled as he enjoyed the admiring gaze that everyone was giving him at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Even though Naomi really despised Danny, she took it in her hand without saying anything else.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“The Hermes Rumble is actually the latest bag launched by Hermes. It is very popular in Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This same exact bag costs about twelve thousand dollars there!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice could not help but gasp when she heard Danny’s words.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny saw the expression on Alice’s face and he quickly said, “Alice, what do you think about this bag? Do you usually do any research on luxury goods?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice looked at Danny and she finally smiled faintly before she replied, “I’d wanted to buy this exact same bag before this but the price is slightly too high…”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny quickly replied, “Alice dear, I’ll get you one for your birthday! Eight or nine thousand dollars is not a lot of money to me anyway. Moreover, I know everyone working at the Hermes boutique store across from our university.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice did not say anything but she simply smiled at Danny.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Even though she did not know Danny personally, she had heard about him before and she knew that he was a playboy.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Unexpectedly, he was also so courageous and generous.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice could not help but feel a little impressed with him at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After that, the head of Gerald’s dormitory and all of his roommates also presented their gifts to Naomi, one after the other.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Their gifts were naturally not as expensive as Danny’s luxury gift, but each of their gifts also cost three to four hundred dollars.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald did not want to interfere and he simply planned to give Naomi his gift after everyone was done.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, at this time, Danny looked at the red plastic bag in Gerald’s hand before he smirked and said, “Gerald, please show us what you bought for Naomi. Just look at the plastic bag in your hand! It’s really very festive.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Danny, can you just shut up? I’d be very happy no matter what Gerald gives me.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Naomi warned Danny again.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Naomi was also looking at Gerald with a hopeful expression on her face.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald regretted his action a little.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Since he was in a hurry, he did not want to wait half an hour for the salesgirl to wrap the bag up for him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He thought that it would just be a simple gathering with a few of their close friends. He did not expect that b*stard Danny to be here too!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Naomi, I bought you a bag too.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Gerald said as he took the bag out of the plastic bag.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice frowned at this time because she really could not believe her eyes.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">This person was so poor! He was really unbelievable.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Wow!” Danny yelled as soon as Gerald took out the bag.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald actually bought Naomi a Hermes bag too! He bought her a luxury item too!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Gerald, could you tell me which market stall you bought this bag from? Is it cheap?”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Danny’s words made all the girls present laugh out loud immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice shook her head slightly at this time.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She originally thought that even though Gerald was poor, he would probably be a good friend.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Alice simply looked down on Gerald now.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“This is the limited edition collector’s Hermes bag that was launched during their 200th anniversary. There are only two hundred units of this bag in this world and each of these bags is worth fifty-five thousand dollars!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice could recognize the bag immediately.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“There are also many imitations on the Internet and the counterfeit bag cost less than one hundred dollars! However, no matter how vain a person is, they wouldn’t buy the counterfeit version of this bag because it’s really embarrassing to use a fake high-end product!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Alice was not polite at all as she glared at Gerald. This person really made her sick!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Naomi initially thought that Gerald would buy some gadgets for her but she really did not expect him to buy her an imitation item instead.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Naomi still smiled as she said, “Thank you, Gerald. I’m very thankful and happy no matter what you get me but you shouldn’t spend so much money in the future.
