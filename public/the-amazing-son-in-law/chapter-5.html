             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The two announcements released by Emgrand Group completely shook the entire Aurous Hill like a high magnitude earthquake. When the Wilson family learned about the ownership change in Emgrand Group, they figured out why the collaboration with the White family had been terminated. It seemed that Emgrand's new owner didn't think much of the White family.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Back to the point, who was Mr. Wade? He simply bought Emgrand Group that was worth hundreds of billions of dollars without batting an eye. He was a little too powerful, wasn't he? Even the richest man in Aurous hill wouldn't be so capable!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">All of a sudden, a lot of wealthy families were about to eagerly make a move. They wish to establish a connection with the mysterious Mr. Wade, on the other hand wish to marry their daughters to him.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Moreover, the announcement about Emgrand Groups' investment of two billion dollars for the hotel construction project also shook the construction and interior decorating Industries in Aurous Hills.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Two billion. They could make a lot of money even tendering scraps of the project! A lot of companies wanted a slice of the lucrative pie, including Lady Wilson, who loved money more than anything! Lady Wilson was over the moon at the moment. Two billion dollar project! This was the perfect opportunity for the Wilson family to get a contract from the mega project. It would bring their family to the next level! </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Hence, she called for an urgent family meeting at the Villa tonight to discuss ways to achieve a breakthrough in Emgrand Group’s mega project. Everyone had to attend!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Later that night, at the Wilson family Mansion, Charlie tags along nicely since lady Wilson had asked for everyone's participation. He knew about the old lady's main agenda for the meeting, so he wanted to take this opportunity to boost Claire!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Harold, Claire's cousin, saw him at the mansion, He mocked disdainfully, "Damn! Charlie Wade, you're very shameless. Where did you find your courage to see Grandma now!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">With an indifferent expression on her face, Claire uttered, "Stop your nonsense. Grandma asked everyone in the Wilson family to come. Charlie is my husband, so of course he is a member of the Wilson family too!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Harold laughed sarcastically. "He is part of the Wilson family? Haha! He is nothing but a live-in son-in-law!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Charlie said, "Dear, let's just let him be, don't argue with him. Let's go in quick, grandma is waiting for everyone."</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Claire nodded and walked into the house without batting an eye at Harold. Harold's face twisted in an irritated grimace, anticipating their embarrassment later. After entering the meeting room, Claire and Charlie found a place to sit in the corner. Very soon, Lady Wilson made a great entrance and the family meeting officially began.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lady Wilson sat on the head of the table. She knocked on the table and started cheerfully, "We, the Wilson family, have been waiting for a chance like this for so many years, a chance that will bring us to the next level, to the peak of the social pyramid in Aurous Hills! The chance is finally here now!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She continued loudly, “This time, Emgrand Group has announced a mega project of two billion dollars. If anyone can tender a project from it, it will bring great and lucrative benefits! Moreover, this is Emgrand Group's first major project after its change of ownership. It is a great opportunity for us! If we can collaborate with Emgrand Group and leave a good impression on the new chairman, we will become very powerful and prominent in the future!" </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The attendees were rather indifferent and impassioned as compared to Lady Wilson's enthusiasm. In fact, it wasn't anything new for the Wilson family wanting to collaborate with Emgrand Group. However, for the longest time, Emgrand Group had ignored the Wilson family's request. What made Lady Wilson think that they could get a slice of the mega pie from them now? It was impossible.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Annoyed by the silence, Lady Wilson's face flushed with anger and she shouted furiously, "Why are all of you dumb now? Do none of you have any confidence in taking a tiny slice of pie from the 2 billion dollars project?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone exchanged nervous glances but no one dared to talk.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lady Wilson was getting more agitated now, she gritted her teeth and declared, “All of you listen to me! Whoever is able to get a thirty million dollar deal from the Emgrand Group will be made the director of our company!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Everyone's jaws dropped to the floor as if a bomb exploded in the room. Lady Wilson ruled the family and the company with an iron fist, so she had never once appointed a director in the company. After all, a director would have a lot of power in his hands that most of the time, only the future successor of the company would be qualified to hold the position.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Now that she used the position as a reward, she must have hoped that she would find someone to do the job with the lucrative reward. It was certain that she was extremely eager for the project.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Although the reward was very attractive, it was not an easy task to accomplish. To strike a thirty million dollar contract deal with Emgrand Group,it was the joke of the century in the eyes of the Wilson family members. Even if Lady Wilson herself went to talk to them, the executives wouldn't even see her, let alone talk about a collaboration.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The conference was as quiet as a church.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lady Wilson slammed the table furiously and shouted, "All of you are descendants of the Wilson family, can't any of you solve the problem for your family?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Then, she turned and looked at Harold. "Harold, I'll pass this job to you!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Harold managed a bitter laugh and quickly said, "Grandma, even the White family has been kicked out by the Emgrand Group. Our family is a level lower than they are, how can we strike a deal with Emgrand..."</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lady Wilson chided indefinitely, "Rubbish! How dare you deny yourself before you even try! You are even more hopeless than the loser Charlie!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Actually, Lady Wilson had no confidence in this either, but she didn't want to be the head of a family that was always at the second or third level of the social pyramid. She wanted the Wilson family to climb a rung higher. Emgrand Groups Mega project was her only chance to make her dream come true now. Therefore, she would not give up even if it was difficult.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She thought that as the eldest grandson, Harold, would accept the task willingly, but unexpectedly, he had refused right in her face! Harold felt dejected and depressed as well. No one in their right mind would accept this impossible task. He was certain that he would be kicked out immediately even before he could walk through Emgrand Groups door. At that time, Not only would he fail on the task but he would also be ridiculed and mocked for his failure. That was why he could never agree with his grandmother's order no matter what.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lady Wilson glared at the rest of the crowd and shouted loudly, “What about the rest of you? Is there no one who would dare take on this challenge?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">At this moment, Charlie nudged Claire with his elbow and whispered, "Darling, accept the mission!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Claire shrieked in surprise, "Are you crazy? It is impossible for Emgrand Group to collaborate with a small company like us!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Charlie smiled lightly and said confidently, "Don't worry, you'll definitely strike the deal!" </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Claire's eyes widened in surprise. "Are you sure?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Charlie nodded seriously and said, "Of course! I don't think you'll have any problems at all! trust me, seize the opportunity. Your status in the Wilson family will shoot up in the future! "</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Claire couldn't explain why, but it was as if she was hypnotized by Charlie's words. She stood up so she could digest what he said and said to Lady Wilson, "Grandma, I'm willing to give it a shot... "</p>
