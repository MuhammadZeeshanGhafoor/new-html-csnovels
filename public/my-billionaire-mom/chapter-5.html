                            <p id="chaptercontent">
                                <p>“What the fuck are you saying? Didn’t you say it was your treat? I even asked you before ordering, didn’t I? When I invited people over, you also agreed to it and now you’re trying to pretend nothing happened?" Lara Jean was furious and pointed angrily at Chuck Cannon.</p> <br><p>Conrad Lee’s face darkened. Moon Cherise, Tia Thomas and their boyfriends didn’t look well either. They just came here for a free meal and didn’t want to pay a penny. Unexpectedly, they encountered such a thing, Lara cried out suddenly and everyone in the restaurant stared at them. They were so embarrassed.</p> <br><p>“You’ve lent me some money, so it is reasonable for me to treat you. Now that I’ve treated you, settle the rest by yourself. I don’t know these people and I don’t have the intention of treating strangers.” Chuck stood up after saying that.</p> <br><p>Lara was so angry that she was going crazy!</p> <br><p>“Fuck, are you trying to play tricks on us?" Conrad glared at Chuck. Was he being forced to pay the remaining 6,000 dollars himself?</p> <br><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t know you!" Chuck looked at Conrad. He wouldn’t have dared to do that previously, but now that he has money, he wasn’t afraid of anyone.</p> <br><p>Conrad stared at Chuck, clenching his fists, but he frowned. Chuck, who used to be timid, was not afraid? This kind of calmness….</p> <br><p>“Fuck, loser, putting on airs? You don’t have money to pay for this meal?" Lara burst out in fury.</p> <br><p>“This person is just reluctant to pay. He did it on purpose. This sort of person even exists, if you don’t have money, don’t put on airs. This is such a disgusting attitude.” Moon shook her head angrily. Being looked at by people around her made her feel so ashamed.</p> <br><p>“That’s right! What kind of person are you? You refuse to pay for a treat! How could there be such a shameless person like you? It sickens me!" Tia was not polite at all.</p> <br><p>Lara continued chastising Chuck in a blast of rage. “Fuck, you have the guts to dupe me? No matter what, you must pay, whether you want to or not!"</p> <br><p>“In that case, that means you’ll treat everyone here to a meal?" Chuck chuckled. His calmness surprised the people around him!</p> <br><p>“Damn it, are you deaf? When did I say I’ll treat them? Why should I treat them? I asked you to pay for us!" Lara was so angry that her face turned scarlet.</p> <br><p>“You say you don’t want to treat everyone here because you don’t know them. Then, why should I treat your friends to a meal? Do I know them?" Chuck retorted sharply.</p> <br><p>“You! Hey!" Lara’s face was as red as blood. She was going crazy!</p> <br><p>Moon and Tia’s expression twitched, they were angry as well but they were rendered speechless.</p> <br><p>“Poor fuck! You’re just a poor fuck!" Lara cursed incoherently. However, she was immediately shocked by her own words!</p> <br><p>Chuck glanced at her. “A poor fuck? If she knew that his mother had given him five million dollars casually, would she still think he was a poor fuck?”</p> <br><p>The corner of Chuck’s mouth curled up and he Accidentally broke a bowl. With a bang, the bowl was smashed to pieces on the ground.</p> <br><p>“Ah? Sir, are you okay?" The waiter asked in a hurry. It was normal for customers to break their bowls, but it was a taboo for a customer to be hurt by it.</p> <br><p>“I’m fine. I’m sorry for breaking a bowl. As compensation, keep this.” Chuck placed all the remaining money in the hands of the dumbfounded waiter.</p> <br><p>“Sir, this…” The waiter was stunned. It was just a bowl and the guest compensated over seven thousand dollars?</p> <br><p>The customers around them were shocked. A 7,000 dollar bowl? And this was still considered poor? He was totally a baller!</p> <br><p>Conrad’s eyes widened in disbelief. How could he spend seven thousand dollars on a bowl that probably cost only two to three dollars? Did he really pick up just twenty thousand dollars?</p> <br><p>Moon and Tia were even more dumbfounded. Seven thousand dollars was their living expenses for two months. How could he just give it away like that?</p> <br>
