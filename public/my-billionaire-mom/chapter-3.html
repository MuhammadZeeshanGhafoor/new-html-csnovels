                                <p>They all knew that Chuck Cannon was a poor man as he always seemed to wear two shirts all year round. Although there was no strange smell, the clothes were so faded and torn that they were simply unsightly.</p> <br><p>Someone asked, “Lara Jean, how much does he owe you?"</p> <br><p>“400 dollars. It is only a day’s expense for me, but for him, maybe a month? Putting aside how much he owes me, this person is really disgusting. He doesn’t deserve to lick my shoes.”</p> <br><p>Chuck’s expression was indifferent. He looked at Lara, taking 400 dollars from his bag and said, “I was really grateful when you were willing to lend me some money when I was starving. But you just slandered me. Let’s call it even now!”</p> <br><p>Lara frowned at the money in his hand. She asked coldly, “Did you steal it or rob it?”</p> <br><p>Someone said, “Let’s check our pockets to see if we are short of money!”</p> <br><p>“I earned it myself”, Chuck said calmly.</p> <br><p>“You?" Lara sneered and said, “Why not take a look at yourself in the mirror. How did you earn 400 dollars in the morning? Did you sell your body or something?"</p> <br><p>The whole class burst into laughter and someone said, “I’m afraid this guy is not worth so much money even if he goes to sell himself.”</p> <br><p>Seeing as so many students laughed at him in the classroom, Chuck sat back, sighed and said “Lara, you should be easier on people.”</p> <br><p>Lara snorted and said, “Then tell me what you have done! Answer some of our questions.”</p> <br><p>Chuck frowned for a long time and made up an excuse. He said casually, “I picked up the money.”</p> <br><p>“Oh, lucky eh?" Lara sneered, her malicious tone full of envy.</p> <br><p>The other students asked with jealousy, “Hey, how much did you pick?"</p> <br><p>Many students were interested and asked one after the other. “Yes, tell me, how much did you pick up?"</p> <br><p>Chuck was speechless. He stared back at his classmates and continued to lie, “Two thousand”.</p> <br><p>“What? You actually picked up two thousand? Damn, that’s my living expenses for more than a month!”</p> <br><p>All the students were surprised and envied him so much. If they had his luck and picked up two thousand, their lives would be more comfortable and easier.</p> <br><p>“Hmph, you suck. Picking other people’s money and claiming it as your own.”</p> <br><p>“Such an embarrassment for our class!"</p> <br><p>When these classmates ridiculed Chuck because of jealousy, Queenie Carson was the only one that stood up for him in the class. But Chuck did not care about such gossip and talk. He just let them talk about it.</p> <br><p>After class, Chuck went to Yvette Jordan’s staff room.</p> <br><p>Because there was no class in the afternoon, Yvette was listening to music in the staff room. When she saw Chuck, her expression soured. “What are you doing here? Didn’t I tell you that you are not allowed to look for me between classes?"</p> <br><p>Chuck said with a wry smile, “I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to move out today.”</p> <br><p>“You are moving out? Are you kidding?" Yvette sneered.</p> <br><p>Since young, she had grown up with Chuck. Knowing him like the back of her hand, how could he move out? Does he want to sleep on the streets?  But he had been timid as a child, even insisting to use her as his body pillow when sleeping. If not for the death of his grandfather, God knows how long she would have to be hugged by him to sleep. </p> <br><p>Such a person sleeping on the streets? He wouldn’t even dare to do that if he had ten times the courage.</p> <br><p>“I am not joking with you. I am moving out today,” Chuck said seriously.</p> <br><p>“Well, let’s see how long you can. Don’t come to me begging like a dog.”</p> <br><p>“I won’t!”</p> <br><p>After Chuck had finished talking, he turned around and left the office.</p> <br><p>Yvette stared at his leaving figure thoughtfully. In the past, no matter how much she scolded him, he wouldn’t dare to talk back. God knows what happened to him today.</p> <br><p>All of a sudden, her phone rang. After picking up the phone, she quickly changed her tone and said, “Hello, Director Chester, what happened you suddenly called me?"</p> <br><p>A middle-aged man’s voice could be heard from the other end of the phone. “Yvette, I heard that your training company is not doing well recently. Do you want me to introduce some business to you?"</p> <br><p>Yvette’s heart was filled with joy. Her business in the training company could be said to be very poor. It was already very difficult for her to make any progress. If she did not show any improvement, she was afraid she would have to close the company in less than a year. She had already lost more than 100,000 dollars in the past two months. It was also because of this that she was recently venting out all her anger on Chuck.</p> <br><p>After hearing Director Chester’s business proposal, a smile appeared on her face. “Yes, thank you for taking care of me, Director Chester!"</p> <br><p>“Well, room No. 1218 in the Triumph Hotel tonight. Come over!”</p> <br><p>“A hotel?" Yvette was a little scared. “Director Chester, why don’t I treat you to a five-star hotel in the urban area? A hotel…”</p> <br><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t even give me face?"</p> <br><p>“No…. No…. It’s just that a hotel…."</p> <br><p>Immediately, a steeled voice was heard from the phone, “Hmph, forget it if you don’t want to come. This business is given by my friend’s company as his employees need to be trained. You should know how much money you can make from a big company with 50 to 60 people. If you don’t want to come, I won’t force you.”</p> <br><p>Yvette was very conflicted. She didn’t want to go, but she didn’t want to waste this opportunity either. Just when she had wanted to negotiate, he hung up all of a sudden.</p> <br><p>“If I don’t take the risk, I’m afraid that I’ll be going bankrupt.” She decided to take the risk!</p> <br><p>After leaving school, she drove home, planning to simply tidy up and change her clothes. However, when she just arrived at the door of her house, she saw Chuck coming out of the house with a suitcase.</p> <br><p>The two of them looked at each other. </p> <br><p>Chuck said, “Wifey…”</p> <br><p>As soon as he spoke, Yvette said with disgust, “Don’t call me like that!"</p> <br><p>“Yvette, no matter what, you’ve been taking care of me after grandpa’s death, if you…”</p> <br><p>Yvette snorted and said, “What’s wrong? Do you regret it? Do you want me to give you a second chance?" Yvette sneered impatiently.</p> <br><p>“No, I mean if you have any difficulties in the future, you can call me.” Chuck nodded before walking past Yvette. After all, he and Yvette had been sleeping on the same bed for so long. He still has some feelings for her in his heart.</p> <br><p>Yvette was also absent-minded for a moment. She didn’t expect that this man, whom she had looked down on, would say such comforting words today. It was as though in a trance, she had found someone to rely upon. But then, she smiled coldly and said, “Tell you? What good would it bring to me? Can you give me money or bring me some customers? You can’t give me anything and you can’t even afford a meal yet you want me to tell you?"</p> <br><p>Chuck shrugged. He still had more than one million dollars in his hand. Even if it was not enough, he still had his mother. The money would be transferred to his account with just a phone call. “If you need money, I can give it to you!”</p> <br><p>Yvette feebly waved and sneered, “You’d better keep the money to buy yourself instant noodles.”</p> <br><p>Chuck did not defend himself. He left with his suitcase. Chuck walked with his suitcase for a while. After inquiring about the hotels nearby, he got in a Taxi and went to the Triumph Hotel.</p> <br><p>The magnificent building, the glorious decorations and the luxurious European interiors shocked him to the core. This was the busiest hotel in the city, whose cheapest standard rooms cost at least 800 dollars. In the past, Chuck did not dare to think that he could spend time in such a place, but now it was different.</p> <br><p>When Chuck was about to go in, he saw Yvette’s car swerving in and packing itself in the parking lot. Chuck was so shocked that he hid aside in a hurry. “This is a hotel! What is she doing here?" Chuck felt extremely bitter in his heart. Is his wifey going to sleep with another man? </p> <br><p>Although the two of them didn’t get a marriage certificate and it was just grandpa’s arrangement, he felt very uncomfortable when he thought that the woman he once held in his arms was going to sleep with another man.</p> <br><p>After Yvette walked in, Chuck took his luggage and went in too. As soon as he entered the door, he heard a strange voice saying, “Oh my God, who is this? Isn’t this Chuck?"</p> <br><p>Chuck turned his head and saw Lara walking in with her boyfriend, Conrad Lee in her arms. Lara’s face was full of scorn as if Chuck was not qualified to come to such a high-end hotel.</p> <br><p>“Who is this?" Conrad asked and glanced at Chuck casually.</p> <br><p>“Chuck Cannon, my classmate, I’m telling you, this guy picked up two thousand dollars, but he didn’t return it and spent it on himself instead. I really admire this kind of person.”</p> <br><p>Conrad glanced at Chuck, the corners of his mouth twitching in sarcasm. “Haha, maybe such a trash hasn’t seen two thousand dollars before.”</p> <br><p>“Don’t talk nonsense with this kind of rubbish. Let’s go in quickly, my dear.” Lara held Conrad’s arm in her arms as if she couldn’t wait to enter the hotel.</p> <br><p>Chuck frowned slightly and ignored them, dragging his luggage into the hotel.</p> <br><p>“A standard room please.” Conrad took out his identity card and Lara followed suit slightly.</p> <br><p>The pretty staff at the front desk checked the hotel’s database and said, “I’m sorry, today’s standard rooms have been fully booked.”</p> <br><p>“Ah…” Lara’s face was full of dissatisfaction and loss.</p> <br><p>Conrad continued to ask, “What about a larger room?"</p> <br><p>“I’m really sorry.” The pretty staff at the front desk checked again, her tone extremely apologetic. “Only the presidential suite” is currently available.</p> <br><p>Conrad probed carefully, “The presidential suite? How much is that?" He said in an hesitant tone. </p> <br><p>For them, they usually get a standard room that costs a few hundred dollars when they got a room. As students, it was already pretty extravagant for them to spend a few hundred dollars like this.</p> <br><p>“Yes, it’s 6,666 dollars for the presidential suite.”</p> <br><p>Conrad shook his head hurriedly, “No, it’s way too expensive.”</p> <br><p>“Forget it, let’s go find another hotel,” Lara muttered and pulled Conrad out.</p> <br><p>But before they went out, they saw Chuck walking to the front desk.</p> <br><p>“This rubbish really thinks that he is rich after picking 2,000 dollars. Just look at his beggar-looking clothes. How dare he try to book a room in this kind of place?" Lara sneered.</p> <br><p>Conrad also sneered. He was pretty sure that the guy had at most two thousand dollars on him. He would be definitely shocked to death when he heard the price for a night in the presidential suite.</p> <br><p>However…</p> <br><p>“How’s that even possible?” Conrad's mind was filled with doubt as he watched Chuck walking towards the elevator with the room’s card in his hand. “What’s going on? Wasn’t there no standard room? How did that trash Chuck manage to get a room?"</p> <br><p>Lara Jean saw it too and she became more and more annoyed. She walked quickly to the front desk and tapped on it hard and asked defiantly, “Hey, didn’t you just say that there was no standard room left? Why did you let that person book one then? Call your manager! I’m going to make a complaint that you’re cheating your customers!"</p> <br><p>Conrad’s face was cold too. After all, he was a VIP member of this hotel. How could he be fooled by such a receptionist? He was full of anger. “Hurry up and call out your manager.”</p> <br><p>The girl at the front desk was stunned. After a long pause, she said helplessly, “You two misunderstood me. The standard rooms are indeed all fully booked. The room that this person has booked is the presidential suite.”</p> <br><p>“How is this possible?" Lara’s face changed, before she retorted hurriedly, “It’s impossible. How can that broke idiot afford to book a presidential suite?"</p> <br><p>The girl at the front desk handed over the receipt which was just issued. When the two of them saw the payment fee, their faces changed.</p> <br><p>“Could it be possible that he picked more than two thousand? Probably twenty thousand?" Conrad could only think of such a possibility.</p> <br><p>“It is very likely!" Lara was even more jealous. That broke idiot actually picked up twenty thousand dollars! This was actually her living expenses for one year! What a stroke of luck!</p> <br><p>“He is really good at spending money! Picking up twenty thousand dollars and spending half of it lavishly, such a spendthrift!" Lara was bitter and her face was full of discontent.</p> <br><p>“Idiots are still idiots. He probably thinks that he is rich with that little sum of money. 20,000 dollars is my dad’s income for three or four days, but my dad will never waste it by booking a presidential suite. How dare a broke idiot like him even spend his slim stroke of luck like that! Hilarious!" Conrad laughed disdainfully.</p> <br><p>Chuck placed his luggage in his room and went downstairs to eat. When Lara saw Chuck coming down from the elevator, she thought of something and whispered to Conrad, “This loser likes to show off, right? Why don’t we play around with him for a while?"</p> <br><p>Conrad was puzzled. “But how?"</p> <br><p>Lara smiled and shouted at Chuck, “Hey, Chuck!"</p> <br>
