             <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Hearing the sound from the front desk, Chuck was shocked to see that these two people had not left yet.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Where are you going?" Lara asked.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck replied, “To get something to eat!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Eat?" Lara was contemplating silently. For a trash like Chuck, he would probably prefer fast food on the streets even after living luxuriously. After all, he was still part of the low-class commoners who would never be able to climb up the ladders of wealth. She coughed and said seriously, “Chuck, I lent you money and you haven’t thanked me, have you?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Although Chuck was disgusted by Lara’s words, he nodded calmly. Although he had borrowed 200 dollars from her and was eventually forced to pay back 400 dollars, it was evident that without the 200 dollars, he would have starved long ago.So he said “Thanking you is what I should do!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara sneered and continued, “My boyfriend and I haven’t eaten yet. Would you like to invite us to have a meal in this hotel?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck nodded and said “Okay.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He took the bait! Lara and Conrad looked at each other. They had eaten here before. Although they ordered the most ordinary dishes, it cost at least a thousand dollars for a few dishes. Three people would cost at least two thousand dollars.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck no doubt loved to show off, he even straight up agreed to it.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Thanks. Let’s go then, I am so hungry.” Lara smiled while holding Conrad’s arm and walked to the restaurant.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck followed them. The three of them found a place in the restaurant and sat down.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Soon, the waiter came over with the menu and said, “Good evening. We have a Friday special offer of set dishes here. Three meat dishes, one vegetarian dish and one soup at only 667 dollars. Would you like to think about it?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The waiter knew that the three of them were students, so he recommended a cheaper option for them.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara shook her head hurriedly and pouted, “I don’t want to have set dishes.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I don’t want it either.” Conrad agreed.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara looked at Chuck and asked cunningly, “Chuck, to thank me, you wouldn’t just treat me to set dishes, will you?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck said casually, “Well, you can order whatever you like.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Seriously? Whatever I like?" Lara snorted and rolled her eyes. How much do you actually have to ask me to simply order whatever I like? So pretentious!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara of course, was more than happy to hear so. She took the menu and pointed at whatever she liked. She ordered a total of seven dishes and at this point, even the waiter’s expression was a little strange. These dishes were all Triumph Hotel’s expensive recommended dishes, costing them around four to five thousand dollars in total. Judging that they were students, how could they afford such expensive dishes? </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He confirmed once more, “Are you sure you want to order so much? Each dish in Triumph Hotel is not only of great quality, but also of great quantity. Generally speaking, four or five dishes should be enough for three people.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara looked at Chuck, attempting to sense panic from his expression. She smiled and asked, “I’ll confirm if you don’t have anything to add on?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck nodded casually. “Yep, that’s all.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The waiter took a look at Chuck with full of sympathy. At first glance, he knew that Chuck had been ruthlessly conned. Yet, he had no choice but to take the menu and leave.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Soon, the dishes were served. There were a lot of dishes and the three of them definitely could not finish them all. </p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara ate only two pieces of beef before getting a more evil idea. “Chuck, it seemed I ordered too many dishes. Since there are such a lot of dishes here, would you mind if I invite a few friends to come over and eat together? It will be livelier!"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck said indifferently, “Well, it’s up to you!”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara looked at Chuck’s calm face and sneered in her heart. At this time, he still pretended to be generous. “Since there’s going to be more people later, it’ll be alright if we add on a few more dishes, right?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck nodded.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara and Conrad looked at each other and chuckled. Then they buried their heads in their meals and continued to eat.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Not long after, two beautiful women came with their boyfriends.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck knew these two beauties. One was called Moon Cherise and the other was called Tia Thomas. However, he didn’t know the two men.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The two of them rushed over after hearing Lara claimed that there was an idiot treating them to food at Triumph Hotel. When they came and realized that the idiot was Chuck Cannon, their faces were full of disbelief.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Tia sat down and whispered in Lara’s ear, “Isn’t this Chuck? Does he even have any money?"</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara said in a low voice, “This idiot has a stroke of luck since he picked up a lot of money.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara called over the waiter. The newly arrived four people ordered dishes, which costed around four or five thousand. All the dishes cost more than ten thousand and Chuck was pretty sure already dying inside. Lara gloated at Chuck’s misery.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The dishes were soon served. The three couples were eating happily. However, no one spoke to Chuck as they isolated him completely.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck had nothing to say either and ate his own food quietly. After a while, since he was almost done with the meal, he called the waiter over to get the bill.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The waiter rushed over with the bill and said respectfully, “Sir, the total is 9,302 dollars.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He looked at Chuck who was dressed cheaply and wondered how he was going to pay.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara, Conrad and the other four who came afterwards looked at Chuck maliciously. They were so happy since they wanted to see him make a fool of himself.</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However, Chuck took out ten thousand in cash from his bag and Lara’s eyes shot open. Sure enough, he had picked up twenty thousand dollars!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Conrad and the others were full of bitterness, but even if he was lucky, what could he do? Today, they would force him to spend everything!</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Chuck took out 3,000 dollars calmly and handed it over to the waiter. After that, he stopped taking out money. Everyone was stunned and puzzled. “Sir, this is 3,000 dollars. This is not enough.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lara said, “Ya, it’s nine thousand and three hundred dollars.”</p> <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“What’s wrong with that? You lent me some money, so it is very reasonable for me to treat you.” Chuck said calmly, “But who are these people? I don’t know them. What does their meal have to do with me?"</p>
