                                <p>*dab* *dab* *dab*

Foot steps of dozens of men running can be heard in the corridor. A young and handsome army officer is running in front followed by dozens of soldiers in uniforms, fully equipped with guns.

"Quick, we have to catch him before its too late." The young officer commanded his subordinates in an anxious tone. After taking a turn they saw a corridor which had a large room on the other side. Everyone increased their pace and the young officer quickly opened the large door and entered the room.

What they saw almost made them puke their guts out. A bloody stench invaded their nostrils and the room is littered with corpses of dozens of armed men. One look and they recognised them as a private force.

The soldiers who entered the room are special forces of USA and they saw many bloody scenes. Even they created many bloody scenes. But what is in their sight gave even these soldiers chills.

Every corpse has a face full of fear and agony and not a single person is without a protruded bone. Yes, protruded bones. Each and every person has at least one bone protruded from their bodies and some of them even had a bone shard pierced deeply into their eyes, throat, hearts and other vitals. These bone shards are taken from their limbs and ribs of their comrades which can be clearly understood after observing the limp arms and legs of some corpses.

In midst of the corpses lying on the floor, there is a young man who seemed to be in his late twenties or early thirties standing with his upper body exposed. He has blood all over his body and face. There are some bullet wounds and blade scars on his well-defined muscles. His jet-black hair is soaked in blood. His palms are equipped with a pair of weird claws. These claws only have sharp nails which resembled a wild beast's, made of metal and each nail is individually connected to a small disc like thing on the back of his palm with small metal joints between which a type of string is passing through. If anyone doesn't know better, they would think that it is a normal metal string but it is a graphene string, the sharpest and the strongest thing in the world.

Looking at the scene the young army officer stopped in his tracks and just stood there looking at the bloody figure.

"You finally came here captain Richard. I was getting tired of waiting." The bloody figure said as he is still looking towards the window from where one can look at the vast ocean.

"You were waiting for me?" the young and handsome army office replied in a somewhat surprised tone.

"Yeah, I was waiting for you. I want you to be the witness of my final master piece, so that you won't have to suffer from it." The bloody figure replied.

"Just surrender Sam. You can't run away anymore. Why are you making it so hard for yourself? Just follow me to pentagon and you can live your rest of the life peacefully. I know you are angry, but your vengeance will shake the balance of the entire world power. I will help you negotiate with them to handover whoever is responsible for the incident." Richard said without caring about the so called master piece.

"Bahahaha, do you really think its that easy captain? Do you know who the culprits are? The heir of Rothschild clan, the heir of the McGregor clan, the prince of morocco, the heir of Samarita family, the heir of Hestia house. Are you confident in getting me their heads?" Sam answered while laughing.

Listening to his words Richard was dumbstruck with shock. He knew the incident has something to do with these families, but he was unaware that it was related to the direct heirs of these families. He was at a loss of words. Before he could reply Sam continued.

"Richard, do you know how much I love her? The only girl who cared for me. The only person who didn't look down on my status as an orphan. But now she committed suicide due to jealousy and l.u.s.t of these rich bastards.

Do you know how I feel when I recall, that while I was working my ass off to save this f.u.c.k.i.n.g world from the global warming which they created without a care, the only person I love was brutally r.a.p.ed for twenty days straight and tortured until she committed suicide. Just because some rich bastards are jealous because their fathers compared me with them since we are of Same age. Do you know how I feel? I hate myself. I hate all the titles I earned as a scientist, engineer, musician, painter, doctor, super soldier, hacker, inventor, weapon creator.

I became so many things at this age of 25 but do you know what I really wanted to be? The greatest friend, the best brother a man could ever be. But all I became is a person with a broken heart and filled with a storm of hatred. Don't you dare try to convince me, if you don't know how I feel." Sam said coldly. His voice was filled with melancholy and resentment.

Richard looked at Sam not knowing what to say at all. He clearly knows what this man before him represents. The bloody figure before him represents the pinnacle of genius, the greatest genius ever born in the history of mankind. An orphan in the streets of India became an existence who can look down on the world with disdain and contempt. He is an inventor, doctor, designer, painter, musician etc., He mastered each and every knowledge that he could access. He is not a Jack of all trades but a master of all trades. And if it isn't enough, he is also a super soldier who could take on a whole battalion of armed soldiers alone. Nobody knew how he managed to do all these things but he did it. Looking at him Richard finally opened his mouth.

"I can't say I can understand your pain. But what I understand is that your life has been too short for all your capabilities to be shown to the world. The world hasn't seen enough of you. You are the greatest creator of the world Sam. But I don't think you already reached your limit. I will take you from here with force if I have to, to stop you from heading towards a dead end. You and I both know that if you get your revenge you will be hunted to the ends of the earth. Please, come with me Sam."

"Thank you, Richard but I can't go back now. I can't let go of those bastards after they forced my Stella to kill herself." After speaking he suddenly moved and pressed a button in front of a computer in the room. Everyone quickly surrounded him.

The monitors in the room showed various locations of mansions factories, office buildings etc, looking at them Richards eyes widened with disbelief. Suddenly every building in the computer screen was hit by a seemingly humongous cane as they were completely destroyed. Every one in the room were dumbfounded.

The biggest consortium of the world and the secret rulers of the whole earth are destroyed just like that.

"Hahahahah." Sam started laughing maniacally. "Finally, Stella you are avenged. There are thousands of people accompanying up th…." *Bam* *Bam* Suddenly two gunshots were fired and interrupted his speech. Two bullet holes were formed in his already wounded body.

Richard came out of his stupor and supported the body of falling Sam. Meanwhile Everyone aimed their guns at the one who shot. He is a lackey of the consortium but he was too late to stop the destruction. Richard look that Sam with endless regret in his eyes.

"Don't worry my friend I already lived my life to the fullest I hope with my life as an example these rich bastards will hold back and watch out". Sam said.

"I am sure they will." Richard sad with assurance.

"Richard, as my only friend I will leave this lab as a parting gift to you. This is God's cane which I used just now. Please keep this alive and make sure every government will behave properly from now on. I want you to be the guardian of world Stella dreamt for before. Sam said.

"I will. don't worry Sam." Richard replied.

"Before death I think I should change my title from the greatest creator to the greatest destroyer after all I just destroyed half the world's power with a single button." Sam said with smirk.

"No, Sam. you don't have to change because you will be the greatest creator and you will be the greatest Destroyer of this world. Nobody world can challenge or dare to challenge that statement." Richard said with a smile.

"haha that's true. goodbye my friend." Sam said as he closed his eyes.

"Goodbye Sam." Richard said with Tears in his eyes.

"At this moment all the soldier in the room aimed at the ceiling and shot 3 rounds as respect. They know what this man contributed for world. He created wonders to help mankind survive more time by removing the threat of global warming. He gave hope per so many people who can't even more due to their ailments.

He is an existence which is living example of miracle but now that existence is dead the greatest creator, greatest destroyer, the greatest genius ever is dead.</p> <br>
