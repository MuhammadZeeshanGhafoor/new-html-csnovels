                                <p>Sam slowly open his eyes only to see endless darkness around him. ahead of him a few feet away there stood a young man who seem to be in his early thirties as his gaze was directed towards him. The man has an extraordinary bearing to him that makes one feel as though they are watching a superior being. the handsome face, sword like eyebrows, sharp gaze everything only made the bearing more Majestic.

'Am I dead? Or am I still alive? Or is this a hallucination?' Sam thought to himself. At this moment the Majestic young man suddenly spoke.

"You are really dead. You are currently in your soul form which I captured. I am Ling tian."

"So, you are saying that you captured my soul after I was shot dead?" Sam asked with an astounded gaze.

"Yes". Ling Tian replied

"Why?" Sam asked bewildered. He didn't get why he was still here and can't believe this situation. It all felt like a dream to him. He didn't believe a soul exists until now.

"Because I saw potential in you which was far from realized. Your previous world so small for your Intelligence.

So, I will give you a chance. A chance to realize your full potential, A chance to live again in a world where only your imagination can limit you. Ling Tian replied.

"There are other worlds with life?" Sam was surprised again. Even when he is alive, he never felt this shocked in a single day.

"There are more things to be surprised about kid. This universe has more things to offer than you can imagine. You will learn it slowly." Ling Tian replied.

Hearing that Sam was completely bewildered. everything still felt like a dream to him. He went in to deep thought. 'Well, I have nothing to lose anything anyway.'

"Sure, but what should I do there? Sam asked

"Live your life to the fullest. Ascend the highest peak where you can look down on anyone under heavens. Then we meet again." Ling Tian replied.

Sam seemed confused by the answer.

"Before I send you, I will give you some knowledge. They are language and some cultivation techniques you will require. You cannot pass down any of these techniques to anyone because they are specifically created for your body constitution and your spiritual Core." Ling Tian continued.

"What are cultivation techniques? What is spiritual Core you mentioned." Sam asked with confusion

"Hahaha don't worry you will know when you arrive into your new body.

By the way there is a final test waiting for you down there that is to find the best contract around you as your first contract if you pass the test you have a present there ,if you fail then think as I granted this life to you can live as you like and forget whatever I said earlier."

After Ling Tian finished everything turned completely dark and Sam lost his consciousness.

When Sam opened his eyes again, he felt great head ache as he saw clear blue sky and floating clouds. He felt a searing pain on his stomach as slowly moved to stand up and he observed his surroundings.

He realized he is in the middle of some woods. The ground around was completely razed as if it was plowed. He checked his body when a searing pain increased at his abdomen.

When he saw it clearly, he was shocked. there are two holes in his stomach as if he was stabbed by something. Each hole is around 2 inches wide.

But for some reason blood stopped flowing from the holes. he stood there dazed for some time thinking if it was dream or not then suddenly a piercing headache started as a set of unknown memories entered mind.

His soul entered the body of a 15 year old boy whose name is also Sam. He doesn't have any last name because, he is an orphan. He is a tailor who lived in a nearby village named Lava rock village.

He made a living off of his tailoring skills by selling clothes he made from the silk he obtained from the silk moths in the woods. As per his routine when he came to woods to collect silk, few kids of his age started running towards him.

Only then realized that they were being chased by a bull like beast. Then they purposefully directed the beast towards him and the beast pierced him with its horns and that's how the original owner died. Sam sighed as he thought. 'Guess I can't escape the fate of being an orphan in this life time too.' As he thought up to this, he slowly made his way towards his village while enduring the pain. When he entered the village, he was shocked for some time when he saw the scene in front of him.

The scene before reminded him of the medieval period. the streets are not clean at all. All the houses are made of mud walls and only some select few are made of stones in a certain area.

Then something came to his mind. The good-looking multiple story houses belong to the village officials, while the mansion belongs to village head. the average looking house belongs to village guards and hunters or some relatively well-off families with rather highly regarded professions.

Normal mud houses belong to Farmers and labor and others. To his surprise even though the original Sam is an orphan he also has a stone house which is both his shop and his house.

While Sam was walking towards his house all the people are watching him with surprised expressions and whispering to each other.

Just when he reached his house and about to open his door, he heard someone calling him.

"Hey Sam, you are here. What happened to you exactly that Oliver said that a 'Blazing earth bull killed you in the woods."

A middle man from next door said as he was walking towards Sam. His name is Michael. He is a blacksmith who lives next door to Sam. When Sam saw him, he didn't know how to react as he knew from this body's memories that he had a very good relationship with him.

Sam forced a smile as he answered. "I am alright Uncle Michael. Don't worry about me Argh..." by the time he finished his words he felt his wounds hurting again. His face became pale as he sweated profusely.

"Easy kid." Michael reached him and held Sam with his hands as he was about to collapse.

"Damn it, kid I thought that Oliver is talking nonsense but who would have thought it's real. The wound is too deep Sam I think only the healer mage can heal you. But that costs a lot. I don't even know how you are still alive."

" Uncle Michael please enter my room and take out the leather pouch under my bed. I will go to the healer." Sam said enduring his pain.

Michael slowly made Sam lay on the floor and made his way into the house. After some time, he came back with a leather pouch in his hands.

"Sam, I don't think you can go alone just wait a bit I will get my push cart. I will take you to the healer." After saying that, Michael went to his house and came back with a push cart which he used to transfer his blacksmith products and materials.

He carefully carried Sam and lay him on the cart and kept his leather pouch beside him and started pushing the cart. At this time, Sam slowly started losing his consciousness.

Sam slowly open his eyes only to see a ceiling made of stones. "Oh, you are awake." somebody said suddenly.

Sam startled due to the sudden voice after he turned towards direction which from which voice came there, he saw a middle-aged man carrying a leather pouch with him then he recognized immediately that leather pouch belongs to himself. The man came towards the bed and gave back his leather pouch then said. "This is your leather pouch, I took my treatment fee, the rest is within the pouch."

Sam opened the pouch there he saw 2 stones size of a quail egg.

"You can leave when you feel that you are ok." The middle-aged man said. Suddenly the door opened and Michael came in.

"Oh, you are finally awake. How are you feeling now?" Michael asked Sam.

"I am ok uncle; I think I just need some rest." Sam said.

"Actually, I heard about you from Oliver. He said you are already dead in the Woods. That's why I came to check your house whether he is lying or not. But when I came you are already back and you are injured. But thank God you are okay. What happened exactly kid?" Michael asked.

"I was really hit by the bull uncle but now I am okay. I don't why, but by the time I got there to collect the cocoons a bull madly rushed towards me and hit me. Even I don't know how I survived." Sam replied. he didn't see any reason for revealing it was done intentionally so he kept quiet.

"Uncle Michael I would like to rest if you don't mind." Sam Said

"Ok kid, don't worry about anything else, just take some rest. goodbye I will visit you again"

.

After Michael left Sam kept staring at the ceiling and tried to understand the situation he is in. According to the memories of original owner of the body, right now he is in a place called desolate land which is a part of Western continent.

In this world the Technology is not that developed compared to the Modern Earth. The people took a completely different path of development because of special circ.u.mstances, that is the presence of spiritual energy.

In this world there is a special kind of energy present everywhere in the atmosphere. And everything is made of spiritual energy the humans here possess unimaginable strength and power by utilizing this spiritual energy. They are called cultivators.

There are two types of cultivator they are Qi cultivators and mages. The Qi cultivators use spiritual energy to develop their body and utilize their body to fight they are also called warriors whereas, the mages use spiritual energy by converting it into form of various elements.

Right now, the middle- aged man who came earlier is also a mage and a mage of light element. The light element mages are not much known to their combat prowess but they are most suitable for healing and are highly regarded. That's why these healers usually charge a lot.

In this world the being a mage or a warrior cannot be directly decided by people themselves. It depends on the body constitution and the spiritual core of the person. If a person has a pure Qi core which is a solid white in color then they are most suitable for Warriors. The person who is suitable to be a Mage will have a pure elemental core. Various types of elements indicate various type of affinity to that particular element.

For example, if a person has a pure red color core it will be fire element, a light blue indicates water core, pale green indicates wind, dark green indicates plants or wood, gold color indicates metal, milky white indicate light element and so on.

Other than the pure mages or pure warriors there are other type of cultivators who has mixed core who can practice both Qi and Elements. They are basically called 'Warrior-Mages'. When a person 14 years old their core will activate. Sam also activated his core last year but the problem is nobody could identify his core.

His core is fully transparent when he tried to absorb spiritual energy, he can absorb it easily and he can also control it well but he was unable to use it for both spells or martial arts.

So, he was not suitable for both types of cultivation so he stopped after he reached third level Initiation stage and solely focused on his tailoring skills and achieved some significant improvements in embroidery.

That's how he was able to earn the spiritual stones in his leather pouch.

Even though they are low grade spiritual stones they are totally high-level currency for normal people. For working hard for an entire year, he was only able to earn only five stones and three of them are already taken away by the healer as a fee for treatment.

Thinking up to this point Sam heaved a huge sigh and closed his.

"Let's have a proper sleep first think about what to do tomorrow." Sam muttered under his breadth and slowly fell asleep.</p> <br>
