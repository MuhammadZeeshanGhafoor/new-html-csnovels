                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Oakheart
                    International Airport, which had always been hustling and bustling, had no signs of tourists at all
                    today. The entire place was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Only
                    thousands of men dressed in camouflage uniforms were present with loaded weapons, waiting in
                    anticipation.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Zone one,
                    clear!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Zone two,
                    clear!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The
                    colonel, Lone Wolf, who carried two stripes and three stars on his shoulders, let out a long sigh of
                    relief after hearing the report.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“The coast
                    is clear. You may alight now, Great Marshal.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    extinguished the cigar in his hand before he slowly walked out of the private jet.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was
                    decked out in a fur coat that rustled in the cold wind. His expression was bland but instilled fear
                    in others, nonetheless.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He exuded
                    an aura like that of a monarch overlooking the world, which made people hold their breaths.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Thousands
                    of soldiers shifted their gaze to him uniformly, their eyes brimming with admiration.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was a
                    living legend and their faith.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Welcome
                    back, Great Marshal!” Lone Wolf hurriedly greeted.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke nodded
                    indifferently.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Great
                    Marshal,” Lone Wolf continued gingerly, “Your family has sent some people to meet you. They are
                    waiting in the lounge.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“They seem
                    desperate for you to return to the family.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke stood
                    rooted to the ground as he looked toward the lounge.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There was
                    indeed a row of people in suits, anxiously awaiting his return.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As their
                    eyes met, the people inside shuddered and couldn’t help but kneel on the ground with pleading eyes.
                </p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It would be
                    a major shock to anyone who saw this scene.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Did the
                    dignified and influential Williams family of Atheville just get down on their knees?</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    snorted, his mind wandering.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He, the
                    original young master of the Williams family in Atheville, had been forced by the head of the
                    Williams family to take his twin brother’s place in jail fifteen years ago.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">No one had
                    spoken up for him in the family, including his parents.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was
                    released from prison five years later.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">And in just
                    a few years, he became a marshal with unparalleled power and the world’s number one God of War.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In the
                    past, when he had experienced the cruelty of life, the Williams family had shown him no concern at
                    all.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">But now
                    that he was rich and powerful, they finally remembered him.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">How
                    ridiculous!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A sense of
                    self-deprecation flashed across Zeke’s face as he responded coldly, “Tell them the moment the
                    Williams family made me go to jail on behalf of my brother fifteen years ago, Zeke Williams died.
                    The Zeke Williams right now has nothing to do with the Williams family of Atheville. Don’t disturb
                    me again or they’ll see torrents of blood before their eyes! Take care of it, Lone Wolf. Don’t
                    interfere with my wedding reception.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lone Wolf
                    nodded hastily. “Yes, sir!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke walked
                    up to the wedding car on the side.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He stroked
                    the jade pendant hanging on his chest. His anger then vanished, tamped down by an obvious act of
                    will.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He couldn’t
                    help but think about the origin of that jade pendant</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Ten years
                    ago, when he had finished serving his time in prison, no one from the Williams family had come to
                    pick him up; no one even sent their regards.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">They had
                    completely forgotten about him.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He was
                    penniless and living on the streets. Starving and dying from the cold, he wanted to end his life
                    there and then.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">But at that
                    critical moment, a little girl passing by had given him a cotton-padded coat and a jade pendant</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“This
                    cotton-padded coat will keep you warm from the cold, and this jade pendant will bring you good luck.
                    As long as you’re alive, there is hope.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She
                    rekindled that spark of hope in Zeke who, in turn, affirmed his determination to make a name for
                    himself.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">So he
                    dusted himself down and embarked on the journey of becoming a soldier.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">There were
                    countless times when he was on the brink of death with no hope of survival whatsoever. Whenever he
                    was in jeopardy, that beautiful and kind silhouette would flash across his mind.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She was
                    Zeke’s conviction to live and motivation to keep striving.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After
                    serving in the military for only five years, he had become the marshal of the armed forces.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In the
                    midst of a national crisis, Zeke had been entrusted with a mission to lead thousands of troops and
                    make a clean sweep across the borders of nine countries. He also had to force them into signing the
                    Nine Nations Treaty of Alliance.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">For five
                    years, Zeke had not been allowed to make a comeback. He was prohibited from using his wealth and
                    power in exchange for fair competition for Eurasia enterprises in those nine countries.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Since then,
                    the Great Marshal had disappeared.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Only the
                    ordinary man, Zeke Williams, returned to Oakheart City. Thereafter, he found the girl, Emily
                    Clemons, who gave him the jade pendant back then and courted her madly.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After five
                    years of dedication, it finally came to fruition.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Today was
                    the day he was going to marry Emily.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">And the day
                    when the Nine Nations Treaty of Alliance expired.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Yesterday,
                    for the first time in five years, he left Oakheart City to go to the United Nations to terminate the
                    Nine Nations Treaty of Alliance, and today he rushed back to attend the wedding.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After
                    tonight, his power and wealth would be automatically reinstated.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Great
                    Marshal,” Lone Wolf called, handing him a list. “Your Grand Comeback Ceremony is scheduled in three
                    days. Here’s the invitation list. Please have a look.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    glanced at the list and said, “Send three invitation cards to my fiancée, Emily. I want her to know
                    that in three days, her husband will be the powerful Great Marshal who overturns the world. Not just
                    some man on the street!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">One hour
                    later, the wedding hall was bustling with noise and excitement.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The guests
                    were discussing what had just happened.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">A moment
                    ago, a team of fully armed troops had sent three invitation cards to the Clemons family.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was not
                    an ordinary invitation card, but an invitation from the Great Marshal, the legendary God of War, to
                    his Grand Comeback Ceremony.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The entire
                    world knew who the Great Marshal was. He was rich and powerful; the idol of many boys and girls.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Those
                    eligible to attend his Grand Comeback Ceremony were either the officialdom tycoons or the consortium
                    tycoons.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However,
                    there was only one slot for ordinary people!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">And it went
                    to the Clemons family!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It was the
                    ultimate honour one could ever receive!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The Clemons
                    family was destined to have their own Cinderella story, going from rags to riches!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">The crowd
                    was overwhelmed with envy and jealousy.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Of course,
                    they were even more envious of the bridegroom today, Zeke Williams.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">How lucky
                    was he to be able to marry Emily at this time!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In the
                    boudoir, Emily’s mother, Madeleine Clemons, was weeping with joy as she held onto the three
                    invitation cards.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Our family
                    has finally succeeded, Emily.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“After we
                    attend the ceremony in three days, our status in Oakheart City will definitely rise.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“By then,
                    there will be countless rich and powerful people who will suck up to us. Our family will likely
                    become part of the upper-class society!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Emily was
                    full of pride. “Yeah, mom. This is really beyond my expectations.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Emily,”
                    Madeleine suddenly said, her voice stern. “Our family is about to climb up the social ladders, and
                    it’s a bit too easy for that poor boy, Zeke, to marry you with just a dowry of three hundred
                    thousand. Don’t you think? How about this? We’ll ask for another three hundred thousand, and if he
                    can’t give us that, he doesn’t deserve to marry you!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Emily
                    nodded, “Whatever you say, Mom. I’ll listen to you.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">In no time,
                    Zeke arrived.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">With hopes
                    and fears written on his face, he walked into the boudoir with flowers in his hand.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Emily, I’m
                    here to marry you.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However,
                    the atmosphere in the boudoir was relatively cold.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke felt a
                    little embarrassed when Emily didn’t accept the flowers he had brought.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Zeke,”
                    Emily’s mother, Madeleine, started. “If you want to marry my daughter today, you have to give us a
                    dowry of another three hundred thousand.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    frowned. “Haven’t I already given you a dowry of three hundred thousand? Why do you want another
                    three hundred thousand?”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Truth be
                    told, a few hundred thousand meant nothing to him.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">As long as
                    she wanted it, he could grant her the greatest wealth she could ever imagine.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">However,
                    his wealth wouldn’t be reinstated until after midnight. He really couldn’t get three hundred
                    thousand at that moment.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I’m sure
                    you’ve heard that our family has received an invitation from the Great Marshal,” Madeleine began.
                </p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Our family
                    is about to climb up the social ladders and become a noble family. Wouldn’t it be disgraceful to my
                    family if word gets out that you became my son-in-law with just a dowry of three hundred thousand?”
                </p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke was
                    speechless.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">You think
                    I’m disgraceful just because you received an invitation from the Great Marshal?</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">But I’m
                    that Great Marshal!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">He looked
                    at Emily. “Emily, what’s your take on this?”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“I think my
                    mom is right,” Emily replied.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Once we
                    attend the Grand Comeback Ceremony, there will definitely be a myriad of rich people proposing to
                    me. Forget about three hundred thousand. I’m sure they can even afford three million. We’re already
                    going easy on you by only asking for three hundred thousand.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    sighed. “How about this? Let’s just get married first and not keep the guests waiting. After that, I
                    can give you thirty million, let alone three hundred thousand.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Emily
                    rolled her eyes peevishly.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Who are
                    you trying to fool? Isn’t that just an empty promise? Get the money quickly and borrow it if you
                    have no money. Otherwise, we are not getting married today.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke felt
                    helpless. When he was about to tell them he was the Great Marshal, the bridesmaid, Lacey Hinton,
                    couldn’t stand it anymore.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Emi, I
                    think it’s best if you get married first. The guests are waiting outside. If you’re going to haggle
                    over the betrothal gifts and make a scene now, Zeke will only become a laughingstock. How can he
                    raise his head in front of his relatives and friends in the future? They will make fun of him for a
                    lifetime.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke
                    glanced at Lacey gratefully.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Although
                    she was just a bridesmaid and only wearing light makeup, she was superior to Emily, in terms of both
                    look and figure.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke was
                    very fond of her because she had helped him pursue Emily before this.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">But
                    unexpectedly, Emily had a fallout with Lacey.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She was
                    jealous of Lacey’s good looks and had been using her. Their friendship was completely superficial.
                </p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“How could
                    you stab me in the back, Lacey? Do you even treat me as a friend? It’s fine that you’re speaking up
                    for Zeke, but you didn’t even get me any gifts on my wedding day. Oh yeah, I forgot. You gifted me a
                    jade pendant ten years ago. A poor sister like you isn’t worthy of being my friend now. Take your
                    stupid jade pendant and leave.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Emily
                    removed the pendant and threw it to Lacey.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Bang!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Zeke stared
                    at that jade pendant, his brain was rumbling. </p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">What?</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">Lacey is
                    the owner of that jade pendant?</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">It wasn’t
                    Emily who had helped me back then, but Lacey?</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">I’ve fallen
                    in love with the wrong woman for five years!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">And for the
                    past five years, I’ve even witnessed Emily bully my lifesaver!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">God is
                    playing games with me!</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">When Zeke
                    regained his composure, Lacey was battered out of her senses and heading out the door.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">After being
                    humiliated and chased out by Emily in public, her mood wasn’t any better than Zeke’s.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Lacey,
                    wait,” Zeke stopped her abruptly.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Let her
                    go, you asshole,” Emily exploded. “If you dare stop her again, you get out too!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“You’re
                    asking me to get out?” Zeke sneered. “Oh, you’ll regret this.”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Regret?
                    You will be the one who’ll regret,” Emily retorted.</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">“Once I
                    attend the Great Marshal’s Grand Comeback Ceremony, there will be countless rich men pursuing me. By
                    then, you will not even be qualified to kneel and lick my boots!”</p>
                <p class="font-NotoSansJP md:text-xl text-lg leading-[180%] md:mb-6 mb-4 first-letter:ml-20">She had
                    thought Zeke would butter her up when she took out the Grand Comeback Ceremony invitation card.</p>
