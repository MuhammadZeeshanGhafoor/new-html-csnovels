                                <p>Little did she expect Zeke to get down on one knee, proposing to Lacey, “Lacey, will you marry</p> <br><p>Me?”</p> <br><p>What?</p> <br><p>Everyone in the room was dumbfounded. Their faces were filled with disbelief.</p> <br><p>Zeke Williams has just discarded his bride on the day of their wedding and proposed to the bridesmaid instead!</p> <br><p>And it’s under the circumstance that the bride received an invitation card from the Great Marshal!</p> <br><p>It was preposterous!</p> <br><p>Lacey doubted for a moment, thinking she had heard him wrong.</p> <br><p>“Lacey,” Zeke said sincerely again. “Marry me. I promise you with the dignity of a man that I will make you the happiest woman in the world, with a lifetime of glory and wealth.”</p> <br><p>Emily was about to go bonkers. “Zeke, you bastard! I may forgive you if you kneel before me and apologize now. Don’t forget, you’ve been in prison for five years. You should thank the gods that I’m willing to give you this chance.”</p> <br><p>“Piss off!” Zeke roared.</p> <br><p>That five years of captivity had scalded his heart. By bringing that up, Emily was obviously sprinkling salt on his wound with no qualms about hurting his pride.</p> <br><p>“F**k!” Emily gritted her teeth. “We’re over! Just you wait after I attend the Grand Comeback Ceremony!”</p> <br><p>In her heart, Zeke was just a simp who was only worthy of submitting himself to her.</p> <br><p>Who was he to scold her?</p> <br><p>Lacey’s eyelids hooded, looking thoughtful.</p> <br><p>She thought of her marriage contract and her perverted fiancé.</p> <br><p>A moment later, she looked up and took the flowers from his hand.</p> <br><p>In a firm tone, she replied, “I do!”</p> <br><p>Zeke heaved a sigh of relief, while the Clemons family blew up in a fit of anger.</p> <br><p>“You b***h! You shameless whore! I’ll kill you,”</p> <br><p>Slap!</p> <br><p>A slap sounded.</p> <br><p>It was Zeke who had slapped Emily.</p> <br><p>Lacey’s heart was racing.</p> <br><p>She was well aware of how good Zeke had treated Emily in the past.</p> <br><p>And to see him slapping Emily because of her…</p> <br><p>Suddenly, another idea came into her mind.</p> <br><p>Emily crumpled to the floor in a dead faint.</p> <br><p>This simp just hit me for another woman! Who is he to slap me?</p> <br><p>“From now on, Lacey is my wife,” Zeke announced. “If anyone bullies her, I’ll kill their entire family! And if that’s not enough, I’ll dig out their ancestral grave!”</p> <br><p>After silently enduring the pain for five years, the God of War finally broke out.</p> <br><p>His tone was murderous, keeping the Clemons family on their toes as they held their breaths.</p> <br><p>Emily suddenly had an illusion.</p> <br><p>This man was not the same man she had known for five years!</p> <br><p>“Let’s go, Lacey.” Zeke gently took her hand.</p> <br><p>“Lacey Hinton,” Emily said through clenched teeth. “I dare you to walk out this door! Don’t forget, you’re just a parasite who lives off my family. Believe it or not, I can make your family go bankrupt right now.”</p> <br><p>In a quandary, Lacey stopped in her tracks.</p> <br><p>She knew Emily had the power to do so.</p> <br><p>Especially now that she had received the invitation card.</p> <br><p>“Lacey, let’s go,” Zeke consoled her. “Even if the sky falls, I will hold it for you.”</p> <br><p>Lacey’s heart pounded again as they exited the boudoir.</p> <br><p>Emily let out a heartrending roar, “A whore and a simp. What a perfect match! I’ll make you both kneel before me and beg me like a dog soon.”</p> <br><p>Outside, the guests were looking forward to the appearance of the newlyweds.</p> <br><p>However, as the door opened, it wasn’t the bride and bridegroom who walked out, but the bridegroom and bridesmaid.</p> <br><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded, their eyes and mouth agape with incredulity.</p> <br><p>A plot that was usually seen on TV was happening in reality.</p> <br><p>The mass couldn’t accept it for a moment.</p> <br><p>Coincidentally, there were also several media reporters at the wedding hall.</p> <br><p>Thereupon, this breaking news took over the entire Oakheart City in just a few hours.</p> <br><p>This wedding had become the talk of the city.</p> <br><p>The bridegroom had discarded the bride on the wedding day and married the bridesmaid instead, even when the bride had received an invitation from the Great Marshal himself.</p> <br><p>The bridegroom had made the stupidest move in the world!</p> <br><p>Zeke drove away with Lacey.</p> <br><p>Halfway down the road, Lacey suddenly said, “Stop, let me go down.”</p> <br><p>Zeke’s forehead puckered. “What’s wrong?”</p> <br><p>“It’s just an act to save your pride that you proposed to me, no?” Lacey replied. “Now that the show is over, I should go home.”</p> <br><p>“Lacey, I am sincerely asking you to marry me,” Zeke said earnestly. “You think I’m the kind of person who fools around with feelings just because of piteous pride?”</p> <br><p>Lacey kept silent.</p> <br><p>She understood Zeke well and knew that he most likely wasn’t acting.</p> <br><p>“Won’t you regret this?” Lacey’s eyebrows drooped. “Emily’s got the Great Marshal’s invitation and her family is about to come to the fore. This is your chance to climb up the social ladder.”</p> <br><p>“If I want the invitation card, I only need to say the words” Zeke laughed. “Since they are so proud of it, I’ll make them servants at the Grand Ceremony.”</p> <br><p>Lacey sighed. “This is not the time for you to brag.”</p> <br><p>“I’m serious. Do you want to attend the Grand Comeback Ceremony? I can bring you there,” Zeke said.</p> <br><p>Lacey didn’t want to hear his nonsense anymore, so she changed the topic, “Also, I’m engaged to Jackson of the Hamilton family…”</p> <br><p>“Everyone in Oakheart City knows that Jackson is a drug addict and a perv. The number of girls he has messed with can’t be counted on one hand,” Zeke said.</p> <br><p>“I know you don’t want to marry him. You had no choice but to agree to this marriage because of your family. Just say the word and I’ll save you from the fire pit.”</p> <br><p>Lacey smiled bitterly. “The Hamilton family has an extensive business empire. Aren’t you worried Jackson will take vengeance on you?”</p> <br><p>Zeke suddenly laughed. “I was ready to fight against the world from the moment you said ‘I do.”</p> <br><p>Lacey’s head jerked up, looking absentminded.</p> <br><p>The man had made her heart flutter once again.</p> <br><p>She purely wanted to use Zeke as a shield originally, but now, her principles were a little shaken.</p> <br><p>The Hamilton family ruled both sides of the law. An ordinary man like Zeke was no rival to them, be it power or wealth.</p> <br><p>How could he fight against them?</p> <br><p>Could a fleeting moment of passion withstand the cruelty of reality?</p> <br><p>The Hamilton family might eventually destroy him.</p> <br><p>“Let’s go home first.” Lacey looked melancholy. “We’ll talk about it later when you get past my parents.”</p> <br><p>For a while, she felt rather flustered.</p> <br><p>Lacey’s home was very crowded that day.</p> <br><p>Early next month, she would marry into a rich family, the Hamilton family. Her uncles, Jeremy Hinton and Scott Hinton had come to her home to congratulate her and present her with gift money.</p> <br><p>“Daniel, the Hinton family is really blessed to have Lacey marrying into the Hamilton family.”</p> <br><p>“The Hamilton family is one of the four major families in Oakheart City. Whatever leaks out of their fingers is enough to feed and clothe the Hinton family.”</p> <br><p>“Who knows if the Hinton family can take this opportunity to become a second-tier family.”</p> <br><p>Lacey’s parents, Daniel Hinton and Hannah Lawson sat in the host’s seats, their faces glowing</p> <br><p>The flatteries of the crowd made the old couple feel proud.</p> <br><p>“It looks like you two didn’t know. The Hamilton family actually got an invitation from the Great Marshal,” Daniel said. “By then, the Hamilton family’s strength will surely rise. It will highly possible for them to become a first-tier family, let alone a second-tier family!”</p> <br><p>What? An invitation card from the Great Marshal?</p> <br><p>Sounds of exclamation filled the room, the atmosphere reaching a climax.</p> <br><p>“Daniel,” Jeremy said. “I heard you recently ran for the position of Head of Department at the hospital. How’s it going now?”</p> <br><p>“Based on my qualifications, it’s basically hopeless to run for the position of Head of Department,” Daniel replied. “But my son-in-law, Jackson, said he’ll help me. This position will be an ironclad guarantee once the Hamilton family intercedes.”</p> <br><p>His words were full of admiration and satisfaction for his future son-in-law, Jackson Hamilton.</p> <br><p>And the crowd followed, praising the said man.</p> <br><p>“Shit, Lacey’s in trouble!” Scott suddenly jumped to his feet, exclaiming with his phone in his hand.</p> <br><p>Daniel’s heart twitched violently. “What is it? Show me quickly.”</p> <br><p>He snatched the phone over to see a piece of breaking news displayed on the screen.</p> <br><p>“On the day of the wedding, Zeke Williams discarded his bride and proposed to the bridesmaid, Lacey Hinton instead…”</p> <br><p>At once, Daniel had a heart attack and he spat out a mouthful of blood, collapsing on the sofa.</p> <br><p>“That rascal… Damn… Damn it!”</p> <br><p>The Hinton family panicked. “Quick, send him to the hospital. He’s having a heart attack.”</p> <br>
