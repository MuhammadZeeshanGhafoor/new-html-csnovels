                                <p>Upon hearing that Jackson got hold of the director, the Hinton family burst with joy.</p> <br><p>“As expected from the child of a prominent family. He has a wide range of contacts.”</p> <br><p>“That trash, Williams, only knows how to mess things up.”</p> <br><p>“You must take good care of Jackson during this time, Lacey. After all, whether your father can become the Head of Department depends on</p> <br><p>Him.”</p> <br><p>“Who knows? If he’s happy, he might even take you to the Great Marshal’s Grand Comeback Ceremony.”</p> <br><p>Lacey’s eyes were slightly red as she remained silent.</p> <br><p>She had clearly heard a woman’s voice on the phone just now.</p> <br><p>“Zeke, I’m sorry…” Lacey sighed. “I guess this is life.”</p> <br><p>Little did she know that the Zeke she had given up on was saving her father in the emergency room at that moment.</p> <br><p>Zeke looked solemn as his hands adeptly maneuvered the silver needles, puncturing each of Daniel’s acupoint with unerring precision.</p> <br><p>Right then, an old man dressed in white came out from the operating room next door.</p> <br><p>He was the director of the hospital who had just finished an operation on a patient.</p> <br><p>When he passed by the operating room where Zeke was in, he suddenly stopped, frowning.</p> <br><p>“Damn it. He’s not our doctor. How did he come in?”</p> <br><p>He subconsciously wanted to walk up and chase him away.</p> <br><p>But when he saw Zeke’s manipulation of the silver needle technique, his eyes suddenly brightened.</p> <br><p>“Could… Could this be the Ammo Needle technique? The finest acupuncture technique created by the Great Marshal? God, I didn’t expect to see the Ammo Needle technique in my lifetime!”</p> <br><p>He stood frozen at the doors, his eyes blazing with admiration as he watched the former’s skills.</p> <br><p>Not only was the Ammo Needle technique effective, but it was also very spectacular.</p> <br><p>Daniel, who was lying on the hospital bed, slowly regained his consciousness.</p> <br><p>Seeing a strange man in casual clothes standing in front of him, Daniel was stunned.</p> <br><p>He didn’t recognize who Zeke was and didn’t know that he was the ‘future son-in-law’ who gave him the heart attack.</p> <br><p>“Who… Who are you?”</p> <br><p>“Don’t move,” Zeke said in a deep voice. “I’m giving you acupuncture.”</p> <br><p>“Acupuncture?” Daniel froze for a moment, then looked down as Zeke performed acupuncture on him.</p> <br><p>A moment later, he trembled with excitement.</p> <br><p>“Ammo Needle… The legendary Ammo Needle! Oh, my God! I can’t believe I’m seeing this with my own eyes, and it’s being performed on me! God, it’s my honor!”</p> <br><p>Soon, Zeke finished with the acupuncture.</p> <br><p>“Man, I’m really impressed,” the director said, running up to him. “I can’t believe you know how to perform the Ammo Needle technique! You have my deepest respect.”</p> <br><p>Daniel hurriedly got off the hospital bed.</p> <br><p>He felt comfortable and a little stronger than before.</p> <br><p>“You’re amazing, my friend. Could you please teach me one thing or two? I’d like to learn from you.”</p> <br><p>“Yes, yes,” the director also responded. “Please teach us.”</p> <br><p>“Please accept my respect, master.”</p> <br><p>Zeke was putting away the silver needles carefully. “I don’t accept apprentices.”</p> <br><p>It’s not that I don’t accept apprentices. It’s just that you’re my future father-in-law.</p> <br><p>It’s nonsensical for you to call me master if I’m going to call you dad.</p> <br><p>Zeke turned around and left.</p> <br><p>“Master.” Daniel and the director followed closely behind. “Please accept us as your apprentices.”</p> <br><p>At the door of the emergency room, the Hinton family was burning with anxiety. The director of the hospital had yet to arrive.</p> <br><p>They began to wonder if Jackson had stood them up.</p> <br><p>Lacey reached for her phone and was about to remind Jackson when Jeremy suddenly shouted, “Look, he’s out.”</p> <br><p>Everyone shifted their gaze to the door of the emergency room and saw three men walking out.</p> <br><p>The one leading the group was Zeke, with Daniel and the director following behind.</p> <br><p>“That trash is still here?” Hannah squawked. “Damn it! He didn’t go into the operating room to mess anything up, did he? That incompetent bungler.”</p> <br><p>“Why do you care so much about that trash?” Jeremy guffawed.</p> <br><p>“The point is, Daniel has recovered. Look, he seems fine. And look who’s beside him; it’s the director of the hospital.”</p> <br><p>Hannah cried tears of joy. “It must be Jackie. He has long invited the director to rescue Daniel. We were wrong to blame Jackson. My son-in-law is reliable.”</p> <br><p>The entire family went up, surrounding Daniel and the director while ignoring Zeke.</p> <br><p>Lacey looked at Zeke with a complicated expression in her eyes. Sighing, she walked up to thank the director.</p> <br><p>“You’re surely gifted with a magic hand, director.”</p> <br><p>“Thank you for saving his life.”</p> <br><p>“Director, to express my gratitude, please allow me to buy you a meal.”</p> <br><p>The director looked completely nonplussed. “I’m sorry, but I’m not the one who saved Daniel. It’s all thanks to my master. I didn’t take part in any of this.”</p> <br><p>The Hinton family was bewildered.</p> <br><p>The director has a master? Where is he?</p> <br><p>“That’s right. My master saved me,” Daniel said.</p> <br><p>“Come, let me introduce you. This is the master who the director and I just met.”</p> <br><p>Daniel walked toward Zeke, bowing. “Master, no words can express my gratitude for you.”</p> <br><p>What the f**k?</p> <br><p>The Hinton family glared so hard at Zeke that their eyeballs almost popped out.</p> <br><p>Zeke Williams, lifesaver, master…</p> <br><p>How do all these connect?</p> <br>
