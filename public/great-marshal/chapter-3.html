                            <p id="chaptercontent">
                                <p>Before Lacey and Zeke arrived at home, she received a call from her mother, Hannah.</p> <br><p>“Lacey, are you trying to piss us off? Look what you’ve done today! You’ve brought so much disgrace upon our family. Your dad had a heart attack, and he’s at Heartland Hospital now. Hurry over.”</p> <br><p>Smack!</p> <br><p>Thunderstruck, Lacey dropped her phone to the ground, her face paled.</p> <br><p>She didn’t think the incident today would be such a big blow to her father.</p> <br><p>“Quick, to the hospital!” Lacey screamed her lungs out. “My dad had a heart attack.”</p> <br><p>“Hmm? Okay.” Zeke made a sharp U-turn and drove toward the hospital.</p> <br><p>Along the way, he made a call to Lone Wolf, who had picked him up at the airport. “Send me the Ammo Needle.”</p> <br><p>Zeke was ready to save his future father-in-law and give him a good impression.</p> <br><p>Besides Great Marshal, he had another identityNeedle God!</p> <br><p>He created the Ammo Needle that had saved</p> <br><p>Many lives, from generals to civilians.</p> <br><p>A puny heart attack was a piece of cake to him.</p> <br><p>On the other end of the line, Lone Wolf’s eyes blazed. “After five years, the Needle God is finally making his move again! I wonder who’s the man worthy of the Great Marshal to take action personally.”</p> <br><p>“Don’t be such a snoop,” Zeke continued. “Also, for the Grand Comeback Ceremony three days later, arrange for the Clemons family to be servants.”</p> <br><p>“Roger that,” Lone Wolf replied.</p> <br><p>After hanging up the phone, Zeke realized Lacey was looking at him strangely.</p> <br><p>“What are you doing?” Lacey asked.</p> <br><p>“I’ll save your father myself,” Zeke replied.</p> <br><p>“Also, I’ve arranged for Emily’s family to be servants at the Grand Ceremony.” |</p> <br><p>Lacey laid dispiritedly against the seat, sighing in disappointment</p> <br><p>Why didn’t I find this man so boastful before?</p> <br><p>Is the Great Marshal’s Grand Ceremony something he can meddle with?</p> <br><p>How ridiculous.</p> <br><p>Not long after, both of them arrived at the hospital.</p> <br><p>The scene at the hospital made Lacey feel as if a knife was stabbing her heart.</p> <br><p>Her mother, Hannah, was kneeling to Emily, begging her for forgiveness while Jeremy and Scott’s families stood by the side, saying nothing.</p> <br><p>Emily looked proud and aloof, acting indifferent to Hannah’s pleading.</p> <br><p>Zeke frowned. “Why is Emily here?”</p> <br><p>Lacey got out of the car and darted toward Hannah. “Mom, get up. Why are you on your knees?”</p> <br><p>Hannah wiped her tears and said, “You came just in time, Lacey. Quick, beg Emily to save your dad. He is in the emergency room, but Emily’s mother is the attending physician and refuses to save him.”</p> <br><p>Both Madeleine and Daniel worked in this hospital. They appeared united outwardly but were divided at heart. They had recently been competing for the position of the Head of Department with each other.</p> <br><p>Coupled with what happened at the wedding today, the two families were practically archenemies.</p> <br><p>It would be strange if Madeleine saved Daniel after what had transpired.</p> <br><p>Now that it was too late to transfer to another hospital, Hannah could only beg Emily on her knees.</p> <br><p>Lacey’s head throbbed.</p> <br><p>She didn’t have time to think too much now. The most pressing matter of the moment was to save her father.</p> <br><p>She had no choice but to let go of her dignity and plead, “Emily, my dad is critically ill. Please do me a favour and let your mom save my dad.”</p> <br><p>Emily sneered. “Isn’t it a little too late to beg me now? Didn’t you bring your husband with you? Ask Zeke to help you then. What are you begging me for?”</p> <br><p>Only then did Hannah know that the person who came with Lacey was Zeke.</p> <br><p>A fresh swell of rage rose in her at once.</p> <br><p>“Lacey, are… are you trying to drive me crazy? Why did you bring this piece of trash with you? You’re blind to take a fancy to him… Don’t you know he is not only a good-for-nothing who lives off a woman but also someone who has served five years in prison?”</p> <br><p>“I’m warning you, Williams. Don’t think you can step into my house. My house has no room for a piece of trash like you.”</p> <br><p>“Don’t worry, Emily. I’ll be sure to teach Lacey a lesson when we go back. It’s all Lacey’s fault today.”</p> <br><p>Emily felt much better upon hearing those words. “Okay. If you want my mom to save him, give us three hundred thousand for the medical bills, but it has to be paid by Zeke.”</p> <br><p>The Hinton family was in a dilemma.</p> <br><p>It was because Zeke couldn’t fork out three hundred thousand that the marriage engagement had been annulled.</p> <br><p>Emily was deliberately picking holes by insisting Zeke to pay the medical bills.</p> <br><p>Zeke sighed. He didn’t expect Emily to be so crude and mean.</p> <br><p>Just how did I spend five years with her?</p> <br><p>“Haha. I believed we could end this happily, but now it seems that you’re determined to dig your own grave. If that’s what you want, I can only fulfill your wish.”</p> <br><p>“Hmph! Don’t change the topic by spouting nonsense,” Emily sniggered.</p> <br><p>“Why? You can’t get the money? Okay, I’ll give you another chance. Kneel and apologize to me, both you and Lacey. Then admit that you’re a simp who isn’t worthy of me.”</p> <br><p>“And that Lacey is just a loose woman who picks up my scrap!” Emily continued.</p> <br><p>Lacey’s eyes were red as her heart trembled.</p> <br><p>This demand is too much!</p> <br><p>However, at the thought of her father not making</p> <br><p>It…</p> <br><p>She had no choice but to compromise to the cruel reality as she bent her legs, about to get on her knees.</p> <br><p>But Zeke quickly stopped her.</p> <br><p>“Lacey, don’t beg her. I’ll treat your father’s illness.”</p> <br><p>Emily cackled arrogantly, “Lacey Hinton, I bet you didn’t know his true colours.”</p> <br><p>“Forget that he’s poor and can’t afford the medical bills. Just look at him, not willing to bow to anything, not even for saving your father’s life. All he does is talk big! He’s my jilted lover, and you’re only worthy of picking up what I’ve jilted.”</p> <br><p>Her every word pierced Lacey’s heart, which was long riddled in holes, like a knife on a chopping board.</p> <br><p>Slap!</p> <br><p>Abruptly, Zeke hit Emily in the face, sending her to the ground and knocking off one of her teeth.</p> <br><p>“As I said, Lacey is my wife. No one can insult her. Since you didn’t remember it the last time, let me remind you again!”</p> <br><p>Zeke’s tone was forceful and lofty.</p> <br><p>Thereafter, there was silence; dead silence.</p> <br><p>The Hinton family was about to explode with rage.</p> <br><p>Son of a bitch. How could you hit her when we’re still begging for help?</p> <br><p>She’s not going to help us at this rate.</p> <br><p>Lacey stumbled backwards, moving away from Zeke.</p> <br><p>Is he a devil?</p> <br><p>He’s going to get my dad killed!</p> <br><p>She was disappointed, regretting her previous choice.</p> <br><p>“Why… Why did you do that?” Lacey’s voice quavered.</p> <br><p>“Not even the gods can insult my wife,” Zeke said solemnly.</p> <br><p>Lacey wanted to scold him but held back her words because of that statement.</p> <br><p>Her mood right now was beyond words.</p> <br><p>After a long time, Emily came back to her senses.</p> <br><p>Her smile was terrifyingly hideous.</p> <br><p>“Haha, nice one, Williams. The Hinton family has found themselves a wonderful son-in-law. Remember, it wasn’t our family who killed Daniel, but Zeke.”</p> <br><p>She walked into the office and slammed the door.</p> <br><p>Hannah collapsed to the ground with a loud thud, her face white as a sheet.</p> <br><p>“You… You get away… Get lost!”</p> <br><p>At this moment, Zeke’s phone rang.</p> <br><p>He fished for his phone and turned away after taking a glance at the screen.</p> <br><p>Of course, he didn’t leave. He went to the emergency room instead.</p> <br><p>Lone Wolf had just sent a message telling him that he had delivered the Ammo Needle to the door of the emergency room.</p> <br><p>Looking at Zeke’s retreating figure, Lacey was devastated.</p> <br><p>There was no grief greater than when the heart died, and that was exactly her feelings for Zeke right now.</p> <br><p>On the other side, after Zeke took the silver needle, he went to the emergency room to treat Daniel, who had gone into shock.</p> <br><p>“Many notable families are willing to give up their family property to ask the Great Marshal for help, but he will always ignore them,” Lone Wolf mumbled to himself.</p> <br><p>“But today, he made an exception for ordinary people! What is love? Why do people live for it? And die for it?”</p> <br><p>On the side, Hannah was leaning against the wall, looking lonely and despondent.</p> <br><p>“It’s over. It’s all over. Zeke Williams has ruined our family.”</p> <br><p>“Lacey, Jackson is a hundred times, a thousand times better than Zeke. Why did you insist on choosing Zeke?”</p> <br><p>Jeremy and Scott’s families started hurling criticisms at Lacey, condemning Zeke.</p> <br><p>They were also infuriated about this.</p> <br><p>Of course, they weren’t angry that Zeke might kill Daniel, but rather about the fact that Lacey didn’t choose the Hamilton family.</p> <br><p>How are we supposed to steal the Hamilton family’s glory if she doesn’t marry Jackson?</p> <br><p>Jeremy had a brainwave. “Hey, stop crying. I’ve got an idea.”</p> <br><p>“Lacey, call Jackson right now. Apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness, then ask him to help us.”</p> <br><p>“The Hamilton family has an extensive network of connections. They even obtained the invitation card from the Great Marshal through connections. So they must know the leaders of the hospital!” |</p> <br><p>Scott chimed in, “Jackson said before that he can make your dad become the Head of Department through his connections, so he definitely knows the leaders of the hospital.”</p> <br><p>Hannah’s eyes lit up. “Sweetie, give Jackson a call, quick.”</p> <br><p>Lacey instinctively wanted to refuse.</p> <br><p>She couldn’t imagine her life after marrying Jackson.</p> <br><p>However, when she saw her mother’s lonely and desperate eyes and thought about her father’s current situation, she gritted her teeth and made the call.</p> <br><p>She decided to sacrifice herself to save her father.</p> <br><p>The call connected.</p> <br><p>“Hello, Jackson? I have a favor to ask.” Lacey’s voice was a little choked.</p> <br><p>On the other end of the line, Jackson was surprised.</p> <br><p>Lacey would usually give him the cold shoulders, but why did she look for him first today?</p> <br><p>Why is she asking me for a favor all of a sudden?</p> <br><p>“What favor?” Jackson asked.</p> <br><p>“Do you know the leaders of Heartland Hospital? My dad had a heart attack and needs a cardiologist to rescue him…”</p> <br><p>Jackson was rejoicing inwardly.</p> <br><p>It was the perfect chance for him to possess Lacey, and the thought of her perfectly sculpted body made him thirsty.</p> <br><p>“I know the director of Heartland Hospital. He happens to be a cardiologist,” he said.</p> <br><p>“Really?” Lacey was delighted. “Please save my father!”</p> <br><p>“I can save him, but,” Jackson paused. “You must promise me something.”</p> <br><p>“What is it?” Lacey asked cautiously.</p> <br><p>“Come to my place tonight.” Jackson put on a nasty grin. “Let’s put on a little show.”</p> <br><p>Lacey felt disgusted by his words.</p> <br><p>But at the thought that her father might…</p> <br><p>It seemed she had no other options.</p> <br><p>Biting her lips, she resigned to him in the end. “Okay.”</p> <br><p>“Haha, see you tonight!” Jackson said.</p> <br><p>Tonight, your long hair will be the reins to my horse. It’s going to be good!</p> <br><p>After hanging up Lacey’s call, he immediately called the director.</p> <br><p>However, no one answered.</p> <br><p>He simply tossed his phone aside and stopped trying.</p> <br><p>“Baby, I’m coming,” he started, throwing himself on a woman on the bed.</p> <br><p>“Time is precious. Hinton’s life is not worth my time. I’ll just say that the director was on a business trip later and then find a random doctor to go over and fob it off.”</p> <br>
