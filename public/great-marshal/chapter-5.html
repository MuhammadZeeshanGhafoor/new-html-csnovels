                                <p>Daniel was startled, not understanding why the Hinton family had overreacted.</p> <br><p>“You passed out, Daniel. You don’t even know what’s going on. You must be mistaken,” Hannah started.</p> <br><p>“He’s just a useless, poor bastard. How could he have saved your life? Don’t be humble, director. We all know the truth. It was Jackson who asked you for this favor to save Daniel, isn’t it?”</p> <br><p>The director frowned. “As I said, I did nothing. It was all my master’s doing. Besides, who’s Jackson? He didn’t call me either. Oh, right, my phone rang twice just now, but the line cut off before I could answer. I’m not sure if it was him.”</p> <br><p>Suddenly realizing something, Lacey hurriedly called Jackson and turned on the speakerphone.</p> <br><p>“Jackson, did you manage to get in touch with the director?”</p> <br><p>“I did,” Jackson replied. “But he’s on a business trip and won’t be able to make it back in time. I’ll contact another doctor for you,”</p> <br><p>“You liar!” Lacey yelled. “You’re a big fat liar! The director is standing right in front of me now!”</p> <br><p>Jackson felt a little embarrassed. “Is it? Maybe | didn’t communicate well with him.”</p> <br><p>“Piss off!” Lacey shouted. “You can’t fool me! You scum! Don’t bother contacting me in the future.”</p> <br><p>“F**k you!” Jackson’s fury sprang to life. “How dare you scold me?!”</p> <br><p>“I’m warning you, we’re getting married on the first next month no matter what. If you have the guts to walk away, I’ll destroy the Hinton family. Also, stay away from that uncivilized man who you met today, or I’ll send someone to kill him.”</p> <br><p>Веер!</p> <br><p>Lacey hung up.</p> <br><p>There was a dead silence after that.</p> <br><p>The dust had now settled that Jackson, whom they placed their hopes on, didn’t take Daniel’s life into his heart.</p> <br><p>But it was Zeke, whom they spurn and reviled, who had turned the tide.</p> <br><p>The Hinton family were overwhelmed with mixed emotions.</p> <br><p>“Master, I bet you’re hungry,” Daniel had yet to figure out that the young man before him was Zeke Williams.</p> <br><p>“Shut up!” Hannah shouted. “He has no right to be your master.”</p> <br><p>“You’re just a woman. What do you know?” Daniel chided. “I would have died today if it wasn’t for him.”</p> <br><p>“Open your damned eyes, you fool. He’s Zeke Williams. The one who caused your heart disease to relapse.”</p> <br><p>Daniel was astonished. He looked like he was about to have another heart attack again.</p> <br><p>Master is actually the despicable ‘future son-in-law’?</p> <br><p>Why is this melodrama happening to me?</p> <br><p>The atmosphere turned awkward.</p> <br><p>Even the director felt embarrassed for Daniel. “Uh… Haha, what a surprise. I didn’t know that Master is your son-in-law. You must have secretly learned medicine skills from him. I think you deserve to be the Head of Department with your capabilities. Get ready to step in.”</p> <br><p>At that, the director turned around and walked away, not planning to meddle in their family affairs.</p> <br><p>Daniel was wild with joy.</p> <br><p>He didn’t expect to be Head of Department so easily.</p> <br><p>But at the thought that he got this position because of Zeke, he really couldn’t celebrate his victory in triumph.</p> <br><p>After all, Jackson was the ideal son-in-law in his heart.</p> <br><p>Emily and Madeleine were walking toward them from afar.</p> <br><p>“Now that Hinton is at a critical stage, I don’t believe the Hinton family will not concede,” Madeleine said.</p> <br><p>“Hmph! I want the Hinton family to get on their knees and beg me like a dog,” Emily replied.</p> <br><p>“Especially Zeke Williams, I want to rip his face apart.”</p> <br><p>Her face was still aching from that slap just now.</p> <br><p>But when they approached the Hinton family, they were instantly stunned.</p> <br><p>Daniel had actually recovered, and his face was ruddy, not like he had just come back from the land of the dead.</p> <br><p>“What… What just happened?” The pair of mother and daughter felt extremely lost as their plan for revenge went down the drain.</p> <br><p>They sighed, readying themselves to leave.</p> <br><p>“Stand there,” Zeke said coldly. “Who gave you permission to leave?”.</p> <br><p>Emily shot daggers at him. “Shut up. You don’t get to talk here.”</p> <br><p>“Oh really?” Zeke sneered. “Then I supposed the new Head, Dr. Hinton, has the right to speak.”</p> <br><p>“Dr. Hinton, your subordinate is really unprofessional to refuse saving life because of a personal grudge. They even asked for a medical fee of three hundred thousand in public. What are you doing with such a subordinate? To harm society?”</p> <br><p>Daniel was momentarily confused.</p> <br><p>He didn’t know what the pair of mother and daughter had previously done.</p> <br><p>Hannah was the first to react. This is a good time for us to take revenge!</p> <br><p>“Daniel,” she shouted. “Fire her now!”</p> <br><p>“I knelt and bowed to her before this, but she refused to save you. She even asked us for three hundred thousand. I’m so pissed!”</p> <br><p>Daniel’s anger flared up. “What?! Get the hell out of this hospital, Madeleine. You don’t deserve to be a doctor.”</p> <br><p>“Haha, I think you have not only a heart disease but also a brain disease,” Madeleine said contemptuously.</p> <br><p>“Everyone knows that I have the best hope of becoming the Head of Department. As for you, don’t even think about it. You want to fire me? In your dreams! Just you wait. When I become the Head, you’ll be the first-“</p> <br><p>Before she could finish, her phone and Daniel’s phone rang at the same time.</p> <br><p>Madeleine instinctively took out her phone and glanced at it. Her face paled while her hands and feet shivered.</p> <br><p>The director had personally sent a notice in their group chat. Daniel Hinton holds the position of Head of Department.</p> <br><p>“No way. How is this possible?!” Madeleine roared hysterically. “I clearly deserve to be Head of Department the most!”</p> <br><p>“Hinton, you must have bribed the director! Did you? You scumbag! Just you wait. Your reputation will soon fall apart.”</p> <br><p>“Oh please,” Daniel snorted. “I disdain to do that kind of thing. On the contrary, some people were dishonest. I bet you bribed the leaders, huh?”</p> <br><p>“Bullshit!” Madeleine retorted. “If you didn’t bribe the director, why would he appoint you as the Head?”</p> <br><p>“Well, all thanks to you,” Hannah chimed in before Daniel could speak.</p> <br><p>“Thank you for giving Zeke away. His outstanding medical skills saved Daniel. He has even accepted the director as his apprentice. Let alone the Head of Department. If Daniel wants to be the assistant director, the director has to grant him that position out of respect for Zeke. Who said my daughter picked up a jilted trash? My daughter has found a treasure! It’s a pity someone didn’t recognize this treasure!”</p> <br><p>W-What?!</p> <br><p>Emily and Madeleine looked at Zeke.</p> <br><p>This trash who can’t even fork out three hundred thousand has accepted the director as his apprentice?</p> <br><p>Why didn’t I realize his capability before?</p> <br><p>Hold up. If I didn’t ask for another three hundred thousand at the wedding, the Head of Department position would have been mine!</p> <br><p>Did I give away this opportunity myself?</p> <br><p>Madeleine instantly regretted her actions.</p> <br><p>She shouldn’t have asked for another dowry of three hundred thousand. What she had lost now was a far cry from three hundred thousand.</p> <br><p>Emily, who had been silent, suddenly spoke up.</p> <br>
